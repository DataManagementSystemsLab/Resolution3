MINUTES 
1. Approval of Minutes for May 14th, 2021
   * The minutes are approved.
2. Faculty Senate Chair’s Report                                 
   * Planning and Budget Committee (PBC)
      * The idea is to create an umbrella committee, with two subcommittees of SPAAR and the Budget subcommittees.  More details will be shared by the President moving forward. The PBC will start as a Presidential Committee. You will receive the finalized document once it is ready. The President will roll out his Performance Planning to Budget process. Later we will revisit the idea of the PBC becoming a college-wide committee, and putting the committee in the bylaws.
   * PRODIG Committee, check your email for the call for nominations.
   * Faculty Enrollment Initiative, watch out for more info in your email. Our contracts end on June 15th, so keep in mind that any activities outside this date during the summer are absolutely optional. We stand by the union and the contract. However, presenting faculty with the opportunities is also important.
   * Please fill out the two surveys provided in the chat and via email 
      * Survey from Faculty Senate, regarding format of faculty and senate meetings next semester. 
      * Survey from FRRC regarding workshop topics.
3. Provost’s Report                 
   * Some allocations were made for research recovery.  There will be a research task force that is very exciting moving forward.
   * Instructional design will continue to support faculty, including learning the Flex classrooms.
4. UUP Report
   * We continue to be concerned about teaching modes for the Fall.  Contact UUP  with any concerns.  Vice President for Professionals is now Sheila Washington.  VP for Academics is now Peter Ikeler.  Other roles were also filled, see the Wavelengths publication.                                
   * Many thanks to the new leadership, who when they arrived on campus starting with Terese Miller, faculty were finally included in the health and safety discussions.
5. SGA Report
   * Olu Ogunlade reports as the new SGA President.
   * Top goals for SGA include: campus garden, dining, and student needs like masks and hand sanitizer.  
6. CAP Resolutions
   * Resolution for the Proposal for a minor in Community Action Psychology is read into the record.  No questions or comments.  The resolution is accepted by unanimous consent.
   * Resolution for the Proposal for Revisions to a minor in Environmental Studies is read into the record.  The resolution is accepted by unanimous consent.
   * Resolution for the Proposal for Advanced Certificate in Forensic Accounting is read into the record.  The resolution is accepted by unanimous consent.
7. Announcement: SUNY Black Faculty and Staff became an independent charitable organization, and the bylaws are being developed.
8. FUAC 
   * FUAC bylaws revision, see meeting documents
      * Faculty ask regarding specifically the guidelines.  The guidelines are maintained by SUNY and they are updated frequently so the goal is to *not* include all the guidelines directly in the bylaws so the guidelines don’t become out-of-date.
      * Grade distributions provided in FUAC files are general and do not violate FERPA.
      * Faculty Senate can approve just the membership part, and other issues can be referred to the bylaws working group.
      * Does the “member of the library” need to be faculty rank?  Perhaps, but this issue should be reviewed by the bylaws working group.
      * Changes in membership only are approved by unanimous consent.  All other issues are referred to the bylaws working group.
