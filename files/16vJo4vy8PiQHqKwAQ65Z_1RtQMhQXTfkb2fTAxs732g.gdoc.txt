FS Chair Handbook
Many an FS Chair have struggled with the “learning curve” of this job!  I’ve been working on documenting my experience as FS Chair, in hopes I can make the job as easy as possible for future FS Chairs.   The new FS Chair Handbook contains 
* a yearly timeline of to-do items
* lists of meetings the FS Chair attends
* best practices
* perhaps most importantly, email templates!!   
Many thanks to Mike Kavic and Andy Mattson for providing me with their files and emails, many of which are now documented in the FS Chair Handbook.  We now have a “long tradition” of Chairs helping Chairs, and future Chairs will be the beneficiaries !!
