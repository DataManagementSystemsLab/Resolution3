AGENDA ITEM


I. Call to Order 12:30 
II. Approval of Minutes from  May 15, 2020 Faculty Senate meeting.                (end 12:40)
● Minutes were accepted as amended, and approved by unanimous consent 
III. Chair’s Report  (Mike Kavic)                                                          (end 12:50) 
* FS Chair Kavic outlined important issues confronting governance this year, including: Covid-19 and safety, transparency in leadership, and budget issues we are facing with New York state. The Chair would like the faculty to play a meaningful role in budgetary issues and decisions.   Good correspondence with the current officer in charge, Dr. Miller, is another priority. 
● There are a number of vacancies on certain committees that need to be filled.  SPAAR, the strategic planning committee, has several vacancies; a School of Education representative is needed for CAP; and there is a vacancy on FUAC. SPAAR also needs a bylaws revision.
IV. Provost’s Report (Duncan Quarless)                                                (end 1:05) 
● Provost Quarless thanked Andy Mattson for his service as Faculty Senate Chair, and welcomed Mike Kavic, the new FS Chair.. The Provost also thanked the faculty for their efforts in preparing for a remote semester this fall. 
● Three 2020 Chancellor’s Award recipients were recognized and congratulated: Drs. Thomas Lilly (Politics, Economics and Law) and Lorenz Neuwirth (Psychology) received the Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Teaching, and Lorraine Todisco (School of Business) was the recipient of The Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Professional Service.  The efforts of other faculty in terms of teaching publications and new grant funding were acknowledged as well.
● Student survey data will go live on Monday, providing some early feedback to see how things are going. Faculty were asked to continue to track student attendance. Be alert in order to identify students who may have technology needs that still need to be addressed. 
● Good News re: Enrollment:  Enrollment targets have been exceeded. The collective effort does not go unnoticed. Special mention and thanks for efforts of the Registrar’s office, headed by Regina Scarborough, for getting students enrolled on time (which required considerable overtime).
* Over 35% of our new of faculty are either from underrepresented minority groups or women in STEM fields. 
* There were six micro-credentials were approved by CAP and by the Senate this past year. Also, some technology-related advancements will allow us to upgrade some of the classrooms in the NAB in anticipation of instruction in Spring 2021.
* Anthony Barbera re: Middle States update:   The Middle States team chair has been appointed. She is Dr. Darlene Smith, the former Provost of the University of Baltimore. November 18th and November 19th will be her preliminary visit, which will be virtual. Dr. Smith will be given a copy of the self study.  The second Middle States visit will be in the spring, after the finalize self-study has been sent. It will be a team visit of about 10 people along with Dr. Smith, March 21st to March 24th.  As of right now it will be on campus. 
* Jacob Heller:  The faculty were informed of Interfolio, an entirely new online system for handling faculty reappointment, promotion and tenure (RPT) evaluations.  Interfolio was selected by a joint task force with representatives of faculty senate, the union, the president's office, and HR -- all involved in the RPT process.  The system is expected to go live by October 1. Jacob Heller is the contact person for any questions. 


V. University Faculty Senate Report (Laurie Morris)                                 (end: 1:20)
* The first plenary session of the SUNY University Faculty Senate, the fall plenary, is scheduled for mid-October.
* A joint statement by the Executive Committees of the University Faculty Senate (UFS), the Faculty Council of Community Colleges (FCCC), and SUNY Student Assembly (SA) on racial equality and social justice, issued in June, was distributed to the faculty.
* One of the bigger current issues is our new SUNY Chancellor, James Malatras, who was appointed by the SUNY Board of Trustees, instead of selected via a search process. A Resolution of No Confidence in Governor-appointed members of the Board, co-sponsored by the UFS, FCCC and SA Executive Committees was also distributed to the faculty.
* The other major issue of discussion among UFS senators addresses coping with Covid-19 on SUNY campuses.  SUNY Oneonta is the first campus to have students leave the campus, and also switch to all virtual classes because of Covid-19 cases on campus.  Whether to send infected students home (at risk of spreading the infection to those living in their homes and communities) vs. keeping and isolating infected students on campus (despite not having sufficient resources/facilities or plans at the ready for such circumstances) has been the main thrust of discussion.  Rural campuses (like Potsdam) are in a particular quandary, with limited medical facilities such as one hospital to service the health needs of a sizable geographic area containing both the campus and the surrounding community.  Senator Morris stated Old Westbury’s decision to have mostly remote and online courses, with no students residing in the dorms, was a good one given the various health concerns and factors to be addressed during the pandemic.  
VI. UUP Report (Martha Livingston)                                                (end: 1:25) 
● Department reps wanted.  Each department needs to choose a representative that disseminates union information to members of their department, engages their department in union campaigns, and other serves as a liaison between their department and the union. 
● The SUNY tenure clock memorandum states anybody in reappointment and pre-tenure mode would have their clock extended for one year automatically.  Faculty who choose to opt out of the extension must inform Academic Affairs.
● The telecommuting agreement between the governor and all state employees is due to expire on October 2, and hopefully will be extended until the end of the year. 
* Meeting Announcements: 
   * General meetings are going to be virtual and during common hour unless stated otherwise. The first meeting will be on September 30th.  
   * A pre-retirement workshop will be held this coming Tuesday, September 15th. 
   * An adjunct-specific workshop will take place on September 24th.




VII. Nomination and Election of Executive Committee Members     (end 1:35)
* Any full-time faculty member of the faculty senate could run for any of the various Executive Committee (EC) positions, except EC Chair and University Senator, which are separate elections held at the end of the academic year.  The EC nominations and elections proceeded as follows:
* Vice-Chair 
   * Jennie D’ambroise was nominated. Nomination was seconded. She accepted and was elected by unanimous consent. 
* Secretary-Treasurer
   * Dana Sinclair was nominated. Nomination was seconded. She accepted and was elected by unanimous consent 
* At-Large Representative to the EC 
   * Two people were nominated: John Estes and Runi Mukherji.   Each candidate introduced themselves; the vote was taken via Zoom. Results indicated a one-vote difference between the two candidates, prompting the Executive Committee to vote to allow both to serve on the committee.  Results were communicated to the Senate later the same day.


VIII. Committee Reports                                                                (end 1:55) 
* Annual Reports:  Written annual reports for SPAAR, CAP, the TLRC and the Green Committee were distributed.  Brief, summary oral reports were provided by chairs/representatives of three of the four committees;  the Green Committee oral report was deferred until the next faculty meeting.
IX.  Sharing of Concerns/Announcements                                                  (end 2:15)
