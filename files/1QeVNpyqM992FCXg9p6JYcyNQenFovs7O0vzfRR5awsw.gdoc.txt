The SIR has been submitted to Middle States, it was due Mar 1.  There will be an MS visit late March or early April (most certainly after Spring Break some time).  At the next Senate meeting there will be a relevant update.  Note the next Senate meeting is the day before Spring Break.  This meeting will be important to get an MS update.  From the Chat, Mike Kavic “Hot off the press, the date for the small team visit from MSCHE has just be settled to be April14 and 15th.”
