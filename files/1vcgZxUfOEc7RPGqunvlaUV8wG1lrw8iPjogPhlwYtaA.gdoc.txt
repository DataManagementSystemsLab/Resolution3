SUNY Budget for AY2021-2022 
* Given the existing, pre-Covid-19 NYS budget deficit, plus revenue losses as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, SUNY came out decently, with regard to AY2021-2022 budget.
* A 5% reduction in NYS funding (as per last year) is in place again for the upcoming year;
* Increases in student success and student support services were provided, including:
   * 20% increase in EOP and EOC funding;
   * $1 million allocated for mental health funding (a doubling of Student Assembly budget for mental health services the previous year);
* $500 increase in maximum individual TAP awards, in efforts to close the TAP-Gap, which is expected to be eliminated by 2024/2025.
* Excelsior awards are unchanged from last year.  Efforts to address/eliminate growing Excelsior-Gap are expected in future budgets.
* A tuition-freeze is in place for the upcoming year (and expected for the next three years);
* Community colleges will receive 98% floor funding or $50 increase per FTE student – whichever is higher. This is more funding from NYS than SUNY asked for, which may be reflecting acknowledgement (finally) of the role and pertinence of community colleges as part of higher education. 
* No state-level early retirement incentives offered, leaving it up to individual campuses to determine.
* SEE: “ Budget Summary (Final)” sent from President Kay (see meeting documents; also emailed 4/9/21)
Federal Funding – Covid-19 Related Funding 
* There are three sources of federal funding, portions of which are allocated to higher education, that are federal responses to the coronavirus pandemic.
   * Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (March 2020)
   * Coronavirus Response & Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA; December 2020)
   * American Rescue Plan Act (March 2021)
* In general, the funding – which may be applied in a variety of categories – is intended to support students, and help them continue pursuing their education despite increased disturbances/disruptions in their lives and education, including increased financial burdens incurred as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and resultant policies put into effect.
* In the case of NYS and SUNY, the additional federal Covid-19-relief funding is a significant lifeline in terms of preventing further budgetary problems, budget cuts, and other loss of resources for and services to students.
* Funding received thus far has largely been for students to address numerous needs, including:
   * tuition assistance
   * housing; food insecurity;
   * technology (e.g. laptops)
   * child care
   * health/mental health services        
* Some associated costs to institutions also eligible for funding include:
   * Costs related to online transition
   * Costs of tutoring
   * Some relief for lost revenue (such as, decreased enrollment; dorm refunds)
* Campuses (i.e. budget officers/budget committees) should review these plans to determine eligibility and process for obtaining some relief from Covid-related costs.
Covid-19: Impact on SUNY/Spring 2021  
* The majority of Spring 2021 courses are remote:  68.5% online, 17.5% in-person, 14% hybrid (SUNY Total as of 4/1/21.) 
   * The Comprehensive Colleges and Technology Colleges have the lowest percentage of online courses – 60.7% online, 16.5%, in-person, and 60.8% online, 30.6% in-person, respectively;
   * Community Colleges have the highest percentage of online courses – 73.8% online; 15.0% in person;
   * 71.0% of Doctoral Institution courses are online, 17.9% are in-person.
* Guidelines for Spring 2021 Commencement have been issued (although subject to updates pending changes in pandemic circumstances or CDC recommendations).  SEE p. 5.
* In addition to the loss of lives due to Covid-19, the biggest impacts of the pandemic and its consequences are:
   * disruption in traditional in-person education, with the resultant pivot to online learning following NYS being put on “pause” in March 2020;
   * disruption to students’ residential lives, including those who were not allowed to reside on campus as well as those who were displaced from their off-campus housing;
   * increased mental health concerns among SUNY students;
   * decreased enrollment due to Covid-19-related changes in students’ lives that prevented them from either attending or successfully completing one or more semesters since the pandemic began;
   * most significant decrease in enrollment of students from lower SES/lower resource communities, impacting the poorer and URM student population disproportionately;
   * problems in a few upstate SUNY areas where local communities experienced increased Covid-19 infection rates attributed to intermingling of SUNY students and the community residents (really bad at SUNY Oneonta!)
* SUNY’s immediate efforts to address decreased enrollment, exacerbated by the pandemic, are focusing primarily on: 
   * attracting, recruiting, and securing/returning those students from lower SES/under-resourced communities lost during the pandemic;
   * continued and expanding supports to meet students’ evolving needs to facilitate retention and degree completion;
   * expansion of “Re-Enroll tp Complete Program”, aimed at getting students who stopped attending SUNY (including pre-pandemic) to return and finish their education.  Targets of this program are also largely URM students / students from lower SES backgrounds; 
   * marketing, networking, recruiting campaigns aimed at NYS residents and potential students (traditional and nontraditional):
      * informing them of the range of educational options available through SUNY (such as fulltime, part-time, fully online programs, mixture of in-person and remote courses)
      * informing them of the short-term/long-term options available (such as earning microcredentials, certificates, undergraduate and graduate degrees);
      * providing information and assistance to potential students (such assistance with applications; application fee waivers when eligible, etc.)
Fall 2021 Reopening
* SUNY would like to return to in-person classes in Fall 2021 – and also have contingency pivot plans in place – just in case.  Given changing status of the virus (infection rates, vaccination rates) and CDC guidance, flexibility is key to keeping campuses and college communities safe.
* SUNY is currently attempting to vaccinate as many students, faculty and staff as possible, on many campuses, as well as the hospital centers.  The resumption of the use of J & J vaccine is good news.
* Community Colleges are more challenged with this task, as many of the CC campuses do not have health facilities.
* As of now, SUNY is not mandating students get vaccinated in order to attend in-person classes this fall – esp. given the current FDA “emergency-use status” of the vaccines.  The legality of such a mandate is uncertain, and SUNY does not want to be sued (as is now the case with Rutgers/State University of New Jersey, after mandating vaccinations for their students.)  
   * Chancellor Malatras intimated that SUNY may very well mandate Covid-19 vaccinations for Fall 2021 attendance once the vaccinations are “fully approved” by FDA (as is the case with other mandated immunizations).  It is hoped that such full approval will happen by some time in June/early summer.
   * In any case, the Chancellor asked for our patience, as final decisions re: Fall Semester are still forthcoming. 
* Chancellor Malatras also requested our input (suggestions, recommendations, best practices) with regard to a successful Fall reopening.


Other News 
* PRODI-g now has its second cohort, with 72 new faculty hires this year.
* SUNY faculty hires between May 2020 – June 2021 will also be given an additional year in the pre-tenure period – due to disruptions encountered due to Covid-19.  As with this past year, eligible faculty must opt out – that is, let their department know they do not wish to have the extra year added to their tenure clock (as per SUNY Board of Trustees)
* According to President Kay, there are currently four presidential searches (Alfred State. Empire State, SUNY Oneonta and SUNY Polytechnic); she noted there may be “a couple” more searches by next Fall.
* SUNY Board of Trustees voted (at their April meeting) to make “Juneteeth” (June 19th) a SUNY holiday (for students, faculty and staff).
* SUNY’s contract with Blackboard expires in 2022.  A new learning system has been chosen, but according to President Kay, we are still in the “restricted period”, with ongoing negotiations between SUNY and the vendor,  She could not tell us the name of the new learning system (although campus administrators should know).
UFS Presidential Election  
* President Kay (SUNY Oswego) has completed her second term as UFS president, a two-term-limited position (Thanks, Gwen!).  She will now serve as the immediate Past President, and will still be present at future plenary sessions during the term(s) of our next president – functioning largely as a historical source of information (when needed).  Immediate Past Presidents also may offer additional input they think is contributory, although they are largely inactive at plenary sessions.  Pete Knuepfler (SUNY Binghamton) has served the senate well as the immediate Past President during President Kay’s  presidency.  (Thanks, Pete!)
* Two candidates ran for our new UFS president:  Heather Maldenado, Senator from Buffalo State College, and James McLean, Senator from SUNY Geneseo.  
   * Candidate statements and CVs (condensed) were submitted by both candidates to the body in advance of the spring plenary (SEE meeting documents);
   * Each candidate also gave a 15-minute speech to the senate body, followed by a Q &A session with both candidates responding to all questions posed.
   * The vote for new President took place on the last day of the plenary, after the discussions and votes on the resolutions.
* Heather Maldenado won the election, with ap. 75% of the vote.  (Congratulations, Heather!!)
Resolutions
* Five resolutions were discussed and voted on at the plenary.  More time was spent debating resolutions at this plenary session than any other I have attended in the past.  (Another effect of covid-19 and virtual plenary sessions!)
* SEE meeting documents, approved Resolutions
   * UFS Resolution: Implementation of 360 Reviews for SUNY’s Management/Confidential (M/C) Employees

7. UUP Report                                                        
   * It is exciting to have folks vaccinated so we can return on campus.
   * Our friends and family members in India are struggling with the pandemic.  See the article Arundhati Roy on India's Covid catastrophe.
   * Mandating or asking about vaccinations presents privacy concerns.  
   * We need to address questions about safety on campus.  Some folks feel pressured to come on campus.

      * on questions in higher education.
      * on health care including the status of adjuncts.
   * The DSI granted tell our members that they are valued or not valued.  This is a small piece of change that can be utilized in other ways such as (one possibility among others) used across the board.  This falls more painfully on our professional members. 


8. SGA Report

The Provost will check on the communication.
   * For students who took an incomplete for the Winter semester but cannot finish this semester, SGA President asks what happens to these students.  The Provost replies that an extension of the incomplete can be granted if there is engagement from the student with the Professor.
   * FS Chair welcomes the new SGA President Oluwademilade Ogunlade.

   * Please fill out the questionnaire regarding the FRRC annual workshop.  See meeting documents.
   * We have less grievances at the moment.  Most grievances arise from the syllabus.
   * There are many issues FRRC discuss: faculty lounge, common hour, parking, etc.


11. FUAC Update                                                         
   * In the meeting documents, see the Information and Deadlines announcement.
   * Thanks to FUAC committee for putting together the list, a chronological record of all award recipients at Old Westbury.  Please email FUAC committee with additional corrections and/or additions to the list.
   * Distinguished and Chancellor’s recipients should look to serve on FUAC, as they are best situated to advise on the evaluation criteria.
   * Email FUAC with your nominations.
   * Next year we will have workshops for FUAC files.


12. Commenmencent Update                                        
   * Events
      * Seeking congratulations compilations video, see email announcement.  You can submit your own video or the office can help you create one.  May 10th is the deadline.
      * In addition to the video congratulations, and the virtual graduation, we will also have 14 small in-person graduation ceremonies by department with no more than 100 students each, between May 24th to May 27th.  These are voluntary for both students and faculty.  Strongly urge faculty to come in full regalia.  Student names will be announced and students will be able to cross the stage. These are graduate-only events.
      * See ceremonies overview, schedule for departments, and RSVP forms https://www.oldwestbury.edu/academics/registrar/commencement/recognition  
      * Faculty express concern about the health risks for the events.  The events will require masks.  Nobody is penalized for not being present.
      * The decision to make them graduate-only was made due to our facilities and resources, so having a quality livestream for guests to watch was important. The livestream will be best accomplished and most reliable indoors, with WiFi, and equipment. The MPR was selected based on size, and ability to have doors open, no bi-directional traffic, and social distancing.
13. Sophomore Jump                                
   * Sophomore year programs were piloted in 2018.  We now have a sophomore coordinator Kaitlin James.  Sophomore Jump program was some workshops in the beginning, but now we have two programs.  The Sophomore certificate is open to the whole Sophomore class, and there are skill workshops, and mentor program pairing students.  Faculty can get involved in the Sophomore Shadow program including informational sessions in particular fields, we are seeking faculty for one-time meetings.  Students undergo training with professional etiquette, networking skills, etc. before meeting with mentors in order to craft their questions and their path so that the meetings with professional mentors can be more meaningful.  Reach out with any ideas.
   * Fill out the form to participate https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=NJAI9TPyEk-nFji39JBDcEuUX08Xj-5NphncpP-i_SJUQ0xQSDJXVE1MRVpCOURNNTc1NUxaMFVIUy4u
   * This is just an introduction, we can also do a workshop.
   * Contact Kaitlin James with questions Janesk@oldwestbury.edu 
14. EIT Accessibility                                                
   * What is it?  Making all electronic documents accessible to students with disabilities.  Just handling special cases (ad-hoc) through OSSD is no longer satisfactory.  Every campus needs to appoint leadership to take this on, and we did.  This includes facilities and maintenance forms, departmental records, all communications with students, it is across the whole of campus.  This process started last year and we are only just in the beginning.  We submitted a plan to SUNY already and we are awaiting feedback.
   * There are five standards:  Web, Classroom, Library, Procurement, and Digital Content Accessibility
   * This is just the beginning of a longer process and conversation.
