INTRODUCTION 
In Fall 2019, President Butts authorized the re-establishment of the Campus Green Committee and  directed Dr. Maureen Dolan (Mathematics/CIS) to organize the effort. During the fall semester,  announcements and information about the committee were provided at Faculty and Senate meetings. Interested faculty were invited to join. Staff in key functional areas across all divisions were invited to  participate. Interested students were referred to the committee by SGA, faculty and staff.  
The Green Committee kick-off meeting was December 3, 2019. Following the standing-room-only  attendance at kick-off meeting (in H-401), larger conference rooms were needed for subsequent meetings  on February 18 and March 12, 2020. Detailed meeting agenda are attached to this report.  
The committee’s last face-to-face meeting on March 12th coincided with the statewide shutdown due to  COVID-19. Progress on sustainability initiatives across the state have been impacted by the pandemic. 
1 
BACKGROUND 
The rationale for a Green Committee on each SUNY campus was established in the Report of the SUNY  Energy Task Force (June 2007), followed by enactment of University Energy and Sustainability Policy by the SUNY Board of Trustees (November 2007). This first system-wide policy to address climate  change included ambitious targets for increased renewable energy and reduced greenhouse gases, and  strengthened requirements for green buildings and operations. The Policy also called for a Sustainability  Officer on each campus, and outlined transformational opportunities for green campus initiatives through  research and training, curriculum, student engagement and public/private partnerships. (Dolan organized  the first efforts for system-wide SUNY Sustainability (2007-2009), and also chaired Old Westbury’s first  Green Committee (2009-2010), convened in response to SUNY’s new Energy and Sustainability Policy.) 
More recently, the Framework for a More Sustainable SUNY was developed by the system-wide  SUNY Sustainability Coalition at the behest of Chancellor Johnson (2018). This Framework aligns  with New York State goals and mandates established for renewable energy and carbon footprint. The  SUNY Framework is also responsive to local and global concerns regarding climate change, greenhouse  gases, recycling and waste stream, food security, social justice and environmental justice. 
It is noteworthy that sustainability targets and polices developed by the SUNY Sustainability Coalition are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). These 17 UN goals  for sustainable development include targets and policies that address poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, diversity, clean air and water, sanitation, clean energy, climate change, innovation,  
sustainable cities, forests and ecosystems, biodiversity, justice, peace and global partnerships. 
In addition to system-wide sustainability goals and mandates in SUNY, New York State continues to  strengthen its policies and regulations in support of renewable energy, recycling and climate action. In  November 2018, the NYS Legislature passed the ambitious “Climate Leadership and Community  Protection Act” (CLCPA). This legislation codifies and accelerates NYS targets for wind and solar power, and establishes funding streams to support green communities and advance sustainability projects  that address climate change as well as environmental justice. 
The CLCPA builds upon Governor Cuomo’s “Reforming the Energy Vision”, which is often simply  referred to as “REV”. This calls for New York State’s accelerated transition to renewable energy and  reduced carbon emissions. Millions of dollars annually are available to support energy, environmental, 
and climate action projects in New York State, including projects related to CLCPA and REV. Such  funds are administered by NYSERDA (the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority),  with funding either appropriated legislatively or collected through the Systems Benefit Charge, assessed  through all private utilities in the state.  
Colleges and universities that have been approved for membership in “REV Campus Challenge” are  eligible to apply for state funding of green campus projects, through a range of NYSERDA program  opportunities. A successful application to join “REV” opens many doors and provides opportunities to  fund capital projects and sustainability initiatives. Funds administered by NYSERDA support a broad  array of energy and environmental projects, including solar and wind, clean energy in new or retrofit  buildings, electric vehicles and charging stations, research, training, innovative curriculum, student  initiatives and community engagement.

PURPOSE / DESCRIPTION: 
The Campus Green Committee is established to: 
∙ Engage the campus community (interested faculty, students and staff) in initiatives that advance  Old Westbury as a Green Campus, consistent with the college’s Strategic Plan, Mission and  Values. 
∙ Pursue best practices for campus sustainability in higher education. 
∙ Support SUNY and New York State goals and policies related to clean energy and climate action  planning. 
∙ Coordinate with the UN Academic Impact program, and include the college’s UNAI coordinator  as a committee member.  
∙ Engage with regional, statewide and national organizations on energy, environment and climate  change – including with the New York Coalition for Sustainability in Higher Education. (Note:  NYCSHE membership is drawn from public and private colleges in all regions of the state. The  organization disseminates information on sustainability models and polices; facilitates workshops,  webinars and student activities; and promotes best practices to advance green campuses.) 
∙ Engage with the SUNY Sustainability Coalition, SUNY system representatives, NYSERDA and  REV Campus Challenge Coordinator. 
∙ Organize committee activities through working groups that include (but are not be limited to): energy and carbon footprint, transportation, recycling and waste reduction, food sourcing and food  security, water conservation, environmental stewardship, sustainability literacy and climate action.  
∙ Raise awareness among campus constituencies of sustainability and climate change, including  goals and actions that call for individual, collective or institutional responsibility. 
∙ Explore opportunities for innovative projects, campus-wide initiatives, potential partnerships and  possible external funding to advance clean energy and green campus initiatives that are aligned  with the college’s Mission and Values, such as in support of environmental stewardship,  sustainability and social justice.  
∙ Provide opportunities, consistent with models in higher education, for student research, student  engagement and service-learning (such as green activities that may involve the Honors College,  First-Year/CALL, independent study, work-study, etc.) 
∙ Provide periodic updates to the President, the Faculty Senate and other interested parties, and  submit an annual report that includes committee membership and working groups, summary of  committee activities, and description of any notable achievements, studies or recommendations.

SUMMARY of ACTIVITIES: 
Meeting agenda attached to this report provide an overall summary of the issues and projects taken up by  the committee in Spring 2020. Activities related to REV Campus Challenge continued into the summer.  The chair also complied with a request from Arthur Angst (Working Group #7) to provide a statement  describing the Campus Green Committee to the Middle States Committee and Task Force Inventory.  A copy of this Green Committee annual report will also be provided to SPAAR Committee Co-Chairs 
An initial focus of the committee was membership recruitment, identification of member’s areas of  interest, discussion of relevant SUNY and state policies, researching possible funding sources, and  organizing the committee into appropriate working groups. This section of the annual report provides a  brief description of activities undertaken by individuals or groups, including student members.  
REV Campus Challenge (“Reforming the Energy Vision”): 
∙ Maureen Dolan worked with the NYSERDA coordinator for REV, and consulted with SUNY  Clean Energy Specialist and facilities staff (Tim McGarry and Scott Libert), to prepare an  application on behalf of the college for the REV Campus Challenge.  
∙ Per SUNY and NYS policies, in order to pursue state funding for clean energy or green campus  initiatives related to new or retrofit buildings or to CLCPA (Climate Leadership and Community  Protection Act), it is essential to apply for membership in the REV Campus Challenge. 
∙ SUNY Old Westbury was approved by NYSERDA as new REV member at ACHIEVER membership level. Of the 18 campuses approved for membership in 2020, Old Westbury is one  of only 4 campuses approved at the ACHIEVER membership level. (See attached REV materials  and 8/25/20 letter from Dolan to Butts for additional details.)  
∙ Evidence of our campus commitment to NYS energy and sustainability goals is supported by: the  re-establishment of our Campus Green Committee; a history of energy efficiency and open-space  conservation; commitment to achieving zero-net energy and installation of solar PV as part of  recent Library renovation; participation in SUNY Sustainability Coalition and NYCSHE; and our  innovative academic initiatives such as FYE/CALL, Honors College, United Nations Academic  Impact (UNAI), and inter-disciplinary sustainability curriculum.  
∙ As an ACHIEVER in REV Campus Challenge, we affirm our commitment to clean renewable  energy and climate action. And recognizing that environmental justice and social justice are  intrinsically linked, our campus acts on the knowledge that the climate crisis (regionally and  globally) disproportionately impacts poor people and communities of color.  
∙ Future Plans: Seek possible support through REV for clean energy, climate action and green  campus initiatives that serve to advance the college’s mission and vision, in service to sustainability, environmental stewardship and social justice. Several committee members,  including Lorenz Neuwirth and Mike Kavic, expressed interest in developing proposals for  external funding. Projects potentially supported through NYSERDA REV include research,  training, student initiatives, solar PV, energy storage, and electric vehicle charging stations. 
4 
Recycling and Waste Minimization  
∙ Information on best practices in recycling and waste minimization was disseminated and discussed  by the committee. The chair shared reports provided by NYCSHE, including on student recycling  competitions sponsored by Recyclemania and NYSAR3 (New York State Association for  Reduction, Reuse and Recycling).  
∙ Many committee members expressed interest in greater recycling on campus, and cited the  benefits of participating in recognized recycling programs. Facilities staff commented on  constraints related to custodial staffing, decreased markets for recycled materials, and fees  associated with joining NYSAR3. 
∙ Committee member Nikki Rodgers (Chemistry lab technician enrolled in graduate sustainability  program at Johns Hopkins) took the lead in researching campus recycling models and possible  funding streams. She reported that several private companies (including PepsiCo and Terracycle)  sponsor recycling programs with cash rebates for their products sold at schools and colleges. 
∙ Committee discussed information from NYCSHE and shared by the chair, on DEC Workshops,  2020 NYS Organics Summit and Beyond Waste Student Summit hosted by NYSAR3.  
∙ Committee member Zarrin Mahmud (SGA) attended the Beyond Waste Student Summit (virtually) on February 22. (see attachment for NYSAR3 information) 
Community Garden: 
∙ Committee members worked with First-Year/CALL and the Honors College to plan and create an  edible campus garden. Phase One of campus garden installation involved preparing a plot of land  for an edible garden, to provide fresh and nutritionally dense food for Old Westbury community.  
∙ Jessica Curran and Anthony Deluca initiated the Food Justice Garden project, with the guidance  and leadership of master gardener Dylan Licopoli. (See attached draft flyer for additional details)  
∙ Unfortunately, the planned Phase One installation of Food Justice Garden, originally scheduled for  March 24, 2020, was postponed because of statewide shutdown due to COVID-19. Food Justice  Garden activities are planned to resume in 2020-2021. 
∙ Erin Toolis volunteered to take a lead role on project to address food security and food recovery.  Such an activity may involve collaborative effort among community garden group, dining  services, and group proposed to work on organic waste reduction.  
∙ Other Green Committee members (Alireza Ebrahimi and Imtiaz Rayman) continued work on an  established organic garden on campus, the Sunchoke Project. This nutritionally dense food, grown by indigenous peoples, is considered native to the region. The Sunchoke Project has been  featured in local publications on Long Island.
5 
Student Research Projects 
∙ The chair provided information on Transforming Our Tomorrow 2020, a student competition  hosted by University at Buffalo and sponsored by NYSERDA. Students across the state were  invited to submit proposals to UB Sustainability, to “present their passion in creating a sustainable  world through clean energy”. Special prize money was to be awarded for student project that  considered the social impact of clean energy, e.g., implications for low-income communities,  developing countries, gender equality and social equity. (see attached UB flyer) 
∙ Three Green Committee student members (Ashley Alvarado, Ammar Koshk, Navpreet Banger)  submitted a proposal to Transforming Our Tomorrow 2020. Their research project discussed  climate change impacts in Egypt, and examined the implications of solar energy for low-income  communities in developing nations. Maureen Dolan served as solar energy technical advisor for  their project. Unfortunately, the student competition to be held at UB in late April was cancelled  because of statewide shutdown due to COVID-19.  
∙ Another student committee member (Imtiaz Rayman) developed a web platform for OW Green,  with Alireza Ebrahimi serving as project advisor. This web project is ongoing and is informed by  campus sustainability models in higher education.  
∙ Future Plans: refine the design for OW Green and upload content to disseminate Green  Committee information. Provide links to relevant sources, including NYCSHE, NYSERDA,  SUNY Sustainability Coalition, UNAI, NYSDEC, NYSAR3 and other sources for sustainability,  climate action and best practices in higher education. 
∙ Future Plans: initiate/facilitate student projects through Campus Green Committee, for example,  research related to campus mapping, tree canopy and carbon sequestration, sustainability audit,  biodiversity, sole-source aquifer, open-space preservation. Enhance student engagement through referrals to Green Committee from FYE/CALL, CSTEP, the Honors College, et al. Explore  potential for student service learning through green/sustainability internships. 
United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI)  
∙ The coordinator for United National Academic Impact (UNAI) program established at the college,  Diana Papademas, was invited to join the Campus Green Committee. Collaboration between Old  Westbury’s UNAI program and Green Committee serves to build synergies between initiatives  with inter-connected goals.  
∙ At the request of UNAI Coordinator, information on UN75 Dialogue Series (April 30th virtual):  “COVID-19 Impact on Climate Change and Our Communities” was disseminated through the  Green Committee.  
∙ The Green Committee will continue to coordinate with UNAI at Old Westbury, serving to advance  the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), which are also supported by the work of  the SUNY Sustainability Coalition. 
6 
Preparation for Earth Day 50th Anniversary 
∙ Committee members (Laura Anker, Jessica Curran, Maureen Dolan, Ali Ebrahimi, Chris  Hartmann, Juan Pablo Galvis, Diana Papademas, Nikki Rogers, Usama Shaikh, Erin Toolis)  participated in planning sessions for Earth Day 50th Anniversary Teach-In.  
∙ The planned weeklong series of events, to include guest speakers, workshops and panels on  environmental and/or climate change themes, was organized by Chris Hartmann, Tom Delgiudice  and Amanda Frisken. The Campus Green Committee was asked to host a panel discussion for  Earth Day, to raise awareness about sustainability and the work of the committee.  
∙ Green Committee members also received information and discussed participation in regional and  national events for Earth Day 50th Anniversary. One such event, promoted through NYSCHE, was  a state-wide and national Power Dialog comprised of student videos about climate change.  
∙ Unfortunately, events planned for the college’s Earth Day 50th Anniversary Teach-In, as well as  many planned regional and national events, were cancelled because of mandated shutdown due to  COVID-19.

SUBJ: REV Campus Challenge 2020 
I hope that you and your family are well. During this period of unprecedented challenges, it is my  pleasure to be able to deliver some very good news.  
Following your authorization to submit an application to NYSERDA for the REV Campus Challenge, I  worked with the NYSERDA Coordinator to complete the REV application process on March 13. When  New York State shut down in mid-March because of Covid-19, the review process was somewhat delayed  as NYSERDA staff transitioned to working remotely. This summer the list of campuses approved for new  membership was announced at a REV Campus Challenge Workshop hosted by NYSERDA.  
Old Westbury has been approved by NYSERDA for membership in the REV Campus Challenge. On the basis of evidence provided in our application, our membership was approved at the ACHIEVER level. Of the 18 campuses (public or private) accepted by NYSERDA as new members in REVCC this  year, Old Westbury is one of only 4 campuses approved this year as a new member at ACHIEVER level.  
Evidence of our campus commitment to NYS energy/sustainability goals is supported by: the re establishment of our Campus Green Committee; a history of energy efficiency and open-space  conservation; a commitment to achieving zero-net energy and installation of solar PV as part of Library  renovation; participation in SUNY Sustainability Coalition and New York Coalition for Sustainability in  Higher Education (NYCSHE); as well as innovative academic initiatives such as FYE/CALL, Honors  College, United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI) and inter-disciplinary sustainability curriculum.  
As an ACHIEVER in the REV Campus Challenge, we affirm our commitment to clean renewable  energy and to climate action planning. Also, recognizing that environmental justice and social justice are  intrinsically linked, our campus acts on the knowledge that the climate crisis (regionally and globally)  disproportionately impacts poor people and communities of color.

New York State created and funded the REV Campus Challenge five years ago, to support Governor  Cuomo’s “Reforming the Energy Vision” program. Statewide, campus membership in REVCC now  consists of 61 Participants, 41 Achievers and 26 Leaders.  
REV membership opens many doors and provides numerous opportunities to fund capital projects and  green campus initiatives. Substantial funds administered by NYSERDA support a broad array of projects:  including solar and wind, clean energy in new or retrofit buildings, electric vehicles and charging  stations, research, training, education, student initiatives, and community engagement. Campus and  regional projects may be eligible for funding through SBC or through appropriations in support of CLCP  (Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, 2019)  
As an ACHIEVER in the REV Campus Challenge, Old Westbury will have the opportunity to  publicize on NYSERDA’s website our notable green initiatives that are completed, in-progress, or  currently planned. Membership in REVCC provides a platform for advancement in renewable energy and  other climate initiatives, such as those in support of zero-net energy, reduced carbon footprint, and the  Governor’s blueprint (“REV”) for a green economy. 
I have included NYSERDA materials related to our acceptance into REV Campus Challenge, including a  Welcome Letter and selected slides from recent NYSERDA REVCC workshop. Most prominent is the  official REV Campus Challenge Achiever “BADGE” - provided by NYSERDA in pdf, JPEG and PNG  formats. Old Westbury now has approval to use and display this REV Achiever BADGE on our college  website, in promotional materials, and in various other reports and publications.  
In addition to the attachments related to REV Campus Challenge (#1-2 listed below), I am also submitting  Campus Green Committee annual report and relevant attachments (#3-4 listed below). I will provide the  Office of the President (via USPS) with a hard copy of all Green materials enclosed with this letter.    
Since your authorization to re-establish our Campus Green Committee enabled our successful  application to NYSERDA for REV membership as an ACHIEVER campus, I thank you for advancing  the college towards a greener future, and appreciate the opportunity to spearhead this important effort.  And as I recall your comments at faculty meetings last year about my longstanding energy focus, I am  reminded that my very first conversation with you upon your arrival in September 1999 was to advocate  for renewable energy. Tempus fugit! 
Congratulations on your two decades at the helm, and best wishes as you transition to a rewarding new  phase of life.
