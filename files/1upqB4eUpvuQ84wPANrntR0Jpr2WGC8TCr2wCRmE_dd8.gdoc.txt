Suggestion Box
Thanks for the great suggestions! We will now track the time for the agenda.  Also, in case there is any hesitation to voice questions and concerns Anonymous Comments section will be available during the meeting although it will not be actively monitored.    Senators, please voice concerns and questions as you see appropriate.  More details will be available during the meeting.


Senators Role in Discussion
In the recent era we may have become accustomed to unanimous consent out of convenience for remote meetings, but remember Senators have a responsibility to openly debate concerns or questions about reports provided to the Senate so please don’t hesitate to speak your substantive or procedural comments.  If untenured or any Senators are concerned about voicing concerns during the meeting, use the new Anonymous Comment feature on the new webpage.  Outside the meeting, any faculty member or Senator is also welcome to meet with the FS Chair one-on-one to express concerns.  FS Chair can summarize in the meeting comments they had received.


A Request
Senators, can you help the EC to monitor both the zoom chat and the anonymous comments?  If you can raise your hand to voice the chats and comments, it would be a great help.  As we all know, monitoring multiple conversations can be very overwhelming when we run meetings and classes!  I like to say to my students, not all questions need to "be yours".  Ask a question because you know someone else needs that question to be asked, ask a question for clarification for someone else.  Any assistance Senators can provide to help monitor the chat and anonymous comments activity would help us run a more effective meeting.


Raise Your Hand Before Speaking
We are all friends here!  I know we are very comfortable interrupting each other because we are all friendly, but during Faculty and Senate meetings please do not speak out of turn and interrupt the Presenter or the FS Chair.  Raise your hand to be recognized.  Presenters listed on the agenda, or the FS Chair, can recognize hands to speak in order.












 Please note the following additional procedural items.
* What it means to Receive Recommendations not part of a regular report of a standing committee
   * Voting no to receive a report indicates you don't agree to receive "delivery" nor to file the contents of the report.
   * Voting yes to receive a report indicates you agree to receive "delivery" and file the contents of the report.
* What it means to Approve Recommendations
   * Voting no to approve a report indicates you do not endorse the contents of the report.
   * Voting yes to approve a report indicates you endorse the contents of the report.
Senators can make a motion to conduct a vote on both resolutions separately. This implies that the Senate has the option of "receiving but not approving"; or "receiving and approving"; or "not receiving and not approving"! Please consider what motions you are prepared to make during the meeting. Don't hesitate to reach out with questions or concerns before the meeting.
