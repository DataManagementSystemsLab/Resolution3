00:47:01	Laura Anker:	If students, or a subset of students, cannot live on campus, will they get the money back for the time they were forced off campus this semester.  The failure to refund this money has caused hardship for some of our students and their families

00:56:25	Jacob Heller:	unmute Duncan!
00:57:23	Andrew Mattson:	Unmuting Laura
00:57:32	Martha Livingston:	The question is what’s happening THIS SEMESTER.
00:58:22	Martha Livingston:	Current cases are NOT moving past ARPT at this moment; waiting on opportunity for committee to view physical files.
00:58:54	Jermaine Archer:	I thought there expected delays Duncan?
00:59:03	Andrew Mattson:	Get ready to approve minutes after the president.  I am going to ask for unanimous consent
00:59:15	Martha Livingston:	Only files that were 100% electronic have moved beyond ARPT to admin.
00:59:44	Michael Kavic:	Martha would you like to go on mic again to clarify?
00:59:50	Martha Livingston:	Sure.
01:00:13	Michael Kavic:	ok Ali 7, Martha 8
01:00:14	Andrew Mattson:	Refer questions to Chris Hobson.  Parts of files are still paper.
01:00:39	Lisa Payton:	Any reason why only 47 percent?
01:00:48	Kathleen O'Connor-Bater:	Thank you, Dr. Butts
01:02:30	Martha Livingston:	Not a question, a comment, about this semester’s ARPT files.
01:02:39	Roger Mayer:	approve
01:02:45	Martha Livingston:	sure
01:02:55	Michael Kinane:	On refunds -- 47 oercent is the prorated portion using the March 22 date students would have come back from Spring Break.  Business & Finance is working to get them done for student by May 15 -- each one is a manual action in the system.
01:04:11	Michael Kinane:	Students with meal plans also get back any unused portion of "Dining Dollars" and "Panther Bucks."  For all funds, they will get a refund unless they ask to have the funds credited to next year.
01:04:28	Lisa Payton:	Thank you, Mike for the clarification.
01:07:32	Andrew Mattson:	Questions for the Provost?  Ask in chat.
01:07:46	Raj Devasagayam:	Thank you for your leadership and work, Duncan.
01:09:37	Martha Livingston:	Duncan, I know that I requested that UUP have representation on the committee. I hope the later version will reflect that representation.
01:10:08	Michael Kavic:	Martha would you like to ask about this on mic?
01:10:56	Michael Kavic:	Questions for Duncan: 1. Ali
01:11:18	Andrew Mattson:	1.  Martha 2. Ali. 3. Mike Kinane (I yield time.)
01:11:46	Andrew Mattson:	Martha get ready to ask on mic when Duncan is done.
01:12:16	Michael Kinane:	I can wait until the end of the meeting, Andy.  Its "off-topic"!
01:14:23	Andrew Mattson:	Your call.  But I am not sure your mic is working.
01:14:39	Kathleen O'Connor-Bater:	Duncan, or anyone, do you know if there is a time limit on for how long the campus will be required (or volunteered) to cede out space for the alternate care facility?
01:15:19	Andrew Mattson:	John Estes:  Find Martha an unmute her if she is unmuted.
01:15:27	Michael Kavic:	Ok you are in the queue.
01:16:05	Michael Kavic:	1. Martha 2. Ali 3. Kathleen
01:16:09	Andrew Mattson:	1. Martha 2. Ali. 3 Kathleen.  Kathleen: on mic?
01:17:21	Anthony Barbera:	Kathleen - I think the alternate care facility will probably stay until the danger of a pandemic ends.
01:18:43	Kathleen O'Connor-Bater:	Anthony, I see this as a potential deterrence to students’ being willing to come to campus for instruction.  I might propose something, but want to run it by someone to see if it makes sense first
01:18:47	Andrew Mattson:	Kathleen: Did Anthony answer your question?
01:19:44	Andrew Mattson:	Kathleen: Mike Kinane has answer.  Do you want to ask on mic or in chat>
01:20:23	Kathleen O'Connor-Bater:	Well, I sort of had a follow-up, which I think of as how to develop a contingency plan by maybe renting “satellite” campus sites in the neighbourhoods, where students could meet with proper social distancing protocols in place.
01:20:46	Michael Kinane:	Let's do it verbally...others might not be watching here.
01:22:01	Michael Kavic:	Kathleen you are up next.
01:22:05	Andrew Mattson:	Kathleen is up next on mic to ask question to be answered by Duncan and Mike Kinane.
01:23:41	Andrew Mattson:	Barbara’ mic is on if she wishes to respond briefly.
01:24:26	Judith Walsh:	Question on laptops for Duncan: students with outstanding debts/bills at the college were not eligible for these laptops. Is this the policy going forward. (not on mic, thanks) Judy Walsh
01:24:55	Andrew Mattson:	We need to move on soon.   Kathleen is up next and then Judith and we are done.  More questions in the chat will be shared with Duncan.
01:25:11	Michael Kavic:	Kathleen followed Judith
01:25:25	Andrew Mattson:	Mike Kavic will ask Judith’s question after Kathleen
01:26:23	Barbara Hillery:	I can follow up with Ali to find out what software he wants
01:27:24	Andrew Mattson:	Thanks Barb!
