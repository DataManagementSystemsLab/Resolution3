After the Dec 10th Senate meeting, President Sams relayed the following via email.


Jennie,


At the last FS meeting, I promised that I would provide an answer to the questions about the 30 computers not yet being set up in the radio station, and the construction status of the MIC.
I have the following to share.
1. In the radio station, 20 computers are being installed right now with the remaining 10 scheduled to be set up "imminently." I understand that folks in the radio station are now aware of this.
2. In the MIC, because the contract was cancelled by NYS Comptroller's Office on 11/29, we had to secure a new contractor who will provide a new proposal by the end of the month. I will provide another update on the status of the project in early January.
Thank you.
Tim
