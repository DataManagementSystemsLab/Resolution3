Hi all,


The usual faculty senate meeting reminder is below but I want to start with two special announcements. 


1. At today’s faculty senate meeting we will welcome the College Council Chair, Mili Makhijani and a 
surprise guest! 


2. On a much less important note, I have an idea I want to share with you. I want to invite you to send me images/short blurbs about things that you think are interesting or noteworthy to share at the end of my chair's report at each senate meeting. It could be related to your research, teaching or just something fun in your area of expertise that you think everyone should know about. 


Thanks!
