      * “I am an underrepresented minority male in the STEM fields that understand DEI or a lack thereof.  I am also an Executive Committee Board Member for the SUNY Black Faculty Staff Collective. I have first hand experienced and continue to experience oppression, unfair, unequal, or different treatment than my peers of the same ranks.  I have been held to different standard through all of my reappointment, tenure, and promotion files and I believe that I can serve as a pivotal voice to help change the culture and the climate of this university that systematically supports mediocrity and ignores, punishes, and shows little recognition and regard for hard working faculty.  More importantly, when faculty are excellent scholars in the college, they are attacked the most, which prevents the college from growing, robs students of faculty putting in the time and effort for innovative teaching, demotivates faculty from applying for extramural funding, and ultimately leads to the current culture of faculty being unwilling to serve on any committees post-tenure.  I believe, if given the opportunity to serve, that I can help change the college culture. However, if this college does not change its current oppressive culture, many faculty will leave this place due to its continuous failure to recognize and reward hard working faculty.”
   * FRRC Rep & self nomination: Alireza Ebrahimi*
      * “I would like to nominate myself for Presidential Committee of Faculty Experience Community and Equity due to the fact that I have active in faculty day to day experience and engagement at Old Westbury for three decades serving as director and chair of Teaching Learning Center (TLC), including: organizing faculty conferences at Old Westbury. I chaired the taskforce for resolving parking problems at Old Westbury. I am currently chair of Faculty Rights and responsibilities which overlook for upcoming Bylaws revision since 2016 in addition to overlook Academic Grievance Committee. I am also Co-chair of Faculty University Awards and a senator. Among other experience seeking ideas to improve Faculty quality of life and engagement. I can name my involvement with interfaith community and students’ clubs and  two annual cultural activities and concerts for the community at Old Westbury for past decades. I would like to explore more ideas and interested to be part of the team and serve.”
   *  Self nomination:  Lisa Lewin*
      * “This is my second year as a member of the faculty in the School of Business, and I now look forward to increasing my service to the College with membership on a College-wide committee. In addition to the chance for me to collaborate with faculty from other departments and to learn more about the operations and culture of the College, I believe that my research and teaching in Organizational Behavior and in Business Ethics will allow me to effectively contribute to The Faculty Experience: Community and Equity Committee. Organizational Behavior analyzes the effects of social and environmental factors on the individuals and groups within an organization, and how they work. This committee is tasked with assessing and improving the work experience and environment for faculty, which can be supported with the academic research on job satisfaction, motivation, organizational justice, and organizational culture, among other areas. A strong, healthy, just, inclusive organizational culture is related not only to employee job satisfaction, but also positive organizational outcomes. By putting our SUNY-OW values into practice, we ensure a supportive environment. Personally, I was attracted to Old Westbury based on many factors, not the least of which was the positive and supportive culture I perceived as well as the seeming satisfaction of the faculty I met. So this is an area that is both important to me, and in which I believe I can contribute to the College. In addition to the areas involving equity and justice, I am also particularly interested in the committee responsibilities such as the training of academic and instructional technologies, and training and development opportunities for faculty and students. “
* 1f. Professional Life and Development Committee
   * TLRC Rep:  Katarzyna (Kasia) Platt*
   * ARPT Rep: Jeanne Shimizu*
   * Self nomination: Keisha Goode**
      * “I love and appreciate the work that TLRC and CETL has done. I have greatly benefited from participating in various activities, and last year co-led a Community of Practice on faculty engagement. All of these various activities can be better held and coordinated on our campus. I have also maintained a relationship with Lehman College's Sociology since I was a graduate teaching fellow. They offered me a space in the ACUE Online Teaching Faculty Development Course (10-months) and it was so incredibly helpful to me; I would love to think about how we can offer things like this to our faculty. Other areas: open access fees, professional memberships and all of the items listed under #4 under this committee description. Thank you for this opportunity!”
	   *  Self nomination: Jessica Williams*
      * “I am interested in serving on the Professional Life and Development Committee. I have chosen this committee, in part, because I have been regularly attending professional development webinars through the National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity (NCFDD) Program and have developed a strong interest in this area. I am interested in not only how I might better my own professional development, but how I might help to build a stronger support system for all faculty doing professional development on Old Westbury’s campus. Some of the trainings I have attended through this program include their Core Curricular Program trainings such as “Cultivating Your Network of Mentors, Sponsors & Collaborators,” “Mastering Academic Time Management,” and “How to Align Your Time with Your Priorities.” I have found their core curriculum program to be insightful and essential in helping me to personally balance my personal life, writing time, teaching, and other areas of professional development and would love to bring a program like this to SUNY Old Westbury’s faculty. As a new Assistant Professor on campus, I have ideas about how we might work to further support our newer and untenured faculty members as they embark on developing their professional lives. This is an area that I am passionate about and would like to work to improve campus support—in terms of funding, but also resources, information, and collegial bonds/mentorship-- for faculty working to grow their professional development. “
	   * Self nomination: Renu Balyan*
      * "We cannot deny the importance of professional development in our lives and the critical role it plays in one’s individual as well as professional growth. Professional life and development can help keep us stay abreast and updated with the latest trends, technologies in the field of our research or academic interest. It becomes all the more important when it is new faculty who might be struggling to make a point and prove their worth. There may be plenty of resources available and number of people who can help and respond to your queries. However, sometimes it gets so overwhelming for a new faculty to approach the right people and resources for all the information one needs for professional development. I am saying this from my experience over the last one year as now that I know what the loopholes are, that I just want to be a part of this so that I can help plan, improve and streamline at least some of the things.  As for my experience in this direction, I am working with undergraduate and graduate students to motivate and introduce them to research so that they can have the best of experience and implement the techniques that they have learned over the years in interesting and useful applications. I am encouraging my students to work on research projects and then write papers that can be presented in a conference or a symposium. I should be able to sponsor/fund them from my grant. From teaching perspective, I am currently Lumen Circles fellow and am exploring different active-learning techniques that can make student’s learning experience worthwhile and fruitful. I am also my department’s CSTEP coordinator so I do engage in activities that will support and fulfill several objectives of this committee. I am passionate, motivated and enthusiastic to work on this committee and feel lot of my goals/objectives meet with those of this committee and if given a chance to serve I can help achieve those goals and objectives well."
   * Self nomination: Mohamed Khalefa*
      * "Through my training and professional work, I have hands-on experience building scalable applications, managing data sets, and databases. My practical experiences include working in different software companies before and after my Ph.D. In addition, I got a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from the University of Minnesota- Twin Cities in databases. Based on my experience, I can recommend and utilize open source tools to provide analytical insights within data.  
I can help build a shared resource space where professors share materials, including datasets, books, code bases, and various other tools. It would be a great resource, especially for the newer faculty members. In addition, it would allow professors to adjust the materials to match their teaching styles.  
Another interesting usage of such a shared resource, that it can help to identify those questions that are already solved on websites such as Chegg.  
I can build tools to extract metadata and keywords from those materials to facilitate searching. I had implemented a scalable system to collect and index metadata for other applications while working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  
Collecting and organizing conversions tools would facilitate transforming materials from across different formats would be helpful. For example, it may be helpful to convert an exam from blackboard to pdf, or import questions from pdf, or a convert presentation from PowerPoint to pdf. These tools could be added to the shared resource space.  
Recently, I have implemented a tool to auto-generate tests. This tool can generate several instances of each exam with distinct versions of the same problem. Each student would get a different version of the exam. This is helpful in ensuring academic integrity. The tool is more flexible and customizable than currently available tools. It avoids pitfalls in generating computed-answers questions in Blackboard. I am currently adding more features to choose and organize questions and I am planning to the tool publicly.  
I have serviced on The Joint Label Management Individual Development awards Review committee."

   * Green Rep: Lori Zaikowski*
   * UNAI Coordinator: Diana Papademas*

   * SAS Self nomination:  Diana Papademas*
      * "Since joining the faculty of SUNY/Old Westbury in 1979, I have worked with our changing administration, faculty, and staff to serve the College's Mission and raise the standards internal to the College, worthy of respect external to the College.  Indeed in the early 1980's we did not have a College Relations office fully staffed, and we started the College Public Relations Committee to interface with the administration and the dedicated interest of the faculty to generate positive information about the College to a sometimes skeptical community.  All that has changed, of course, and we have a skilled College Relations office and Alumni Affairs office, dedicated to the ""external"" information generated about the College.
My professional experience as well as degrees in Sociology and Communications (Syracuse University) have been both scholarly oriented and practically oriented to aligning the mission of the College in practice and to fostering the external ""brand"" of the College to the wider community....as a College linked to that wider community.  My initiate in establishing the College as a United Nations Academic Impact College is one example of the linkages that I understand as important to ""partnerships"" and to generating a real, viable image of the College as one that fulfills its Mission of global citizenship and excellence.  
While there are a number of other committees that I would value serving (Social Justice), I believe there are other faculty prepared to do so, and, therefore, I believe I could bring expertise, concern, willingness to the College Branding....Committee.  I could be a SAS faculty member and/or an at-large faculty member. "
