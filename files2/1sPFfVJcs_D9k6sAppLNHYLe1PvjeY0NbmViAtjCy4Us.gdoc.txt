OFFICE OF ACADEMIC AFFAIRS 
Old Westbury’s PRODiG Proposal 
The attached proposal was submitted by the College in response to a call from the  SUNY Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to apply for support from the "Promoting  Recruitment, Opportunity, Diversity, Inclusion and Growth" – or PRODiG – Initiative.  The PRODiG Initiative was conceived “to increase the representation of historically  underrepresented faculty at SUNY[,] including underrepresented minority (‘URM’)  faculty in general, [and] women faculty of all races in STEM fields (‘WSTEM’)” (see  https://www.suny.edu/prodig/faq/).  
Please be advised that the attached proposal document contains information that  should be read within the context of the PRODiG proposal guidelines (appended to this  memo). Specifically: 
• The maximum possible support for a tenure-track hire under the PRODiG  Initiative is $90,000/year; accordingly, the proposal asks for that maximum - $90,000 – for each of the anticipated hires (see p. 25 in the proposal). This  amount does NOT represent the actual anticipated salaries for new hires, which  will be subject to the same general parameters for hiring new tenure-track  faculty, which have not changed.  
• Hiring projections contained in the proposal were based on the best information  at the time of submission and are just that - projections; the College’s actual tenure track hiring processes that are now underway are not contained in the  proposal. 
• Two of the tenure-track faculty hires who began their appointments in Fall 2019  should, in the College’s estimation, be eligible for PRODiG support; therefore, the  salaries negotiated for those two positions are included in the 2019-2020 portion  of the budget proposal, also found on p. 25. 
This proposal, if successful, will materially improve the College’s ability to support and  increase the diversity of the tenure-stream faculty through support for URM and W STEM hiring going forward.

SUNY PRODiG Initiative 
Guidelines for Campus Plans 
1. Background/Introduction 
While SUNY has significantly increased the diversity of its student population, and campus  leadership at the highest level, we have been less successful in increasing the diversity of our  faculty. Our data reveal a pronounced gap between the racial/ethnic diversity of SUNY faculty  members (8.6%) as compared to the diversity of the students they instruct (28.5%, Fall 2018). This  3X gap is expected to grow if SUNY campuses do not take steps to overhaul their hiring practices  and methodology. 
PRODiG (“Promoting Recruitment, Opportunity, Diversity, Inclusion and Growth”) aims to increase  the representation of historically underrepresented faculty at SUNY including underrepresented minority (“URM”) faculty in general, women faculty of all races in STEM fields (“WSTEM”). This is consistent with SUNY’s role in creating pathways to social and economic opportunity for all our  students, as well as personal and intellectual fulfilment. Each of these underrepresented groups  face persistent barriers to social and economic mobility both as students and after graduation.  Increasing the representation of faculty members who understand, and have overcome, race-and  gender-based barriers and biases is important to the success and well-being of our students. And  where other groups are underrepresented in a field due to the persistence of barriers to social and  economic mobility, efforts to address this underrepresentation will receive consideration for  PRODiG funding as well. 
Moreover, faculty diversity benefits the broader academy. A diverse faculty is critical to academic  excellence because, as research demonstrates, diverse teams are more innovative, productive,  and solve complex problems faster and better.1 Furthermore, faculty diversity is key to preparing  all students to live and work in an increasingly global, diverse and interconnected world by  exposing students to a wide array of ideas, experiences, cultures, and individuals.  
Where faculty candidates are underrepresented in certain academic disciplines due to persistent  barriers, they will be considered for PRODI-G salary support on a case-by-case basis. 
For further background on PRODI-G, see this memo. 
2. Project Goals  
As announced in the Chancellor’s 2019 State of the University System address, PRODiG is designed  to create changes in faculty recruitment and retention processes that will result in the hiring of  
 
1 Scott Page, The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies (Princeton University  Press, 2008).

Updated Guidelines – 6.20.19/p.2 
underrepresented faculty and provide support to campuses for the hiring and retention of up to  ~1,000 underrepresented faculty members in the next decade, or roughly doubling the diversity of  our full-time faculty. 
National higher education policy research suggests that four factors are the primary impediments  to faculty diversity: (a) narrow pipelines and pathways into academic careers for  underrepresented students, (b) outdated faculty recruitment and retention practices, (c) faculty  diversity myths that abound in higher education (including the view that faculty diversity is  incompatible with academic excellence), and (d) the decentralized administrative culture of the  academy.2 
PRODiG aims to tackle these impediments with a comprehensive -- not piecemeal -- approach.  PRODiG focuses on: 
• identifying historical underrepresentation within the ranks of faculty; 
• growing the pipeline of URM and WSTEM students into academic careers; • insisting that campuses employ best practices empirically proven to reduce barriers to  diversity in the faculty search process, and at the same time;  
• creating a collective focus on broadly assessing and improving recruitment and retention  processes across the campus (i.e., establishing an integrated approach whereby faculty affairs, human resources and diversity offices work together to propose solutions).  
By engaging campuses in identifying the impediments that most affect their ability to hire URM  and WSTEM faculty, and supporting their conclusions with data, PRODiG also seeks to expose and  debunk the myths that may function as proxies for the actual challenges campuses face in hiring URM and WSTEM faculty.  
The following elements target an array of barriers to faculty diversity (see diagram): 
• Search committee education and certification pilot 
• SUNY-wide Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (“HERC”) 
• Cluster hire pilots  
• Startup packages on a case-by-case basis 
• Annual teaching and mentoring conferences -- one for high-achieving URM students, and  one for high-achieving WSTEM students 
• Graduate Stipends (one-time graduate research stipends of $5000 each to support  incoming PhD students) 
• Three years of salary support for full-time entry- and mid-level faculty on a case-by-case  basis, based upon available historical and projected data (100% of salary up to $90k in Year  1, 50% up to $45k in Year Two, and 30% up to $27k in Year Three) 
• Grants to support elements of campus plans, based upon demonstrated improvement of  faculty hiring process and enhancement of pipeline-building

Updated Guidelines – 6.20.19/p.3 
The guidelines and application steps outlined below, are designed to engage campuses in a robust  process of self-assessment, reflection and collaboration that results in creative, deliberate,  innovative, and strategic new plans for removing barriers to diversity. Furthermore, these steps  should elicit plans that leverage the unique resources, challenges and opportunities of individual  campuses, as well as, the resources provided through PRODiG.  
Each campus is expected to convene a dedicated, diverse PRODiG Committee broadly drawn from  faculty hiring and graduate pipeline “influencers” and leadership across the campus, and provide  data from the Provost Office on the impact on PRODiG. This will ensure a collective, centralized campus focus on the impediments to faculty diversity, as well as strategies for removing them  across the academic units.  
The steps outlined below are guides to preparation for, and implementation of, campus PRODiG  proposals. Each year, all previously awarded campuses seeking subsequent PRODiG funding will  be required to update, renew and build upon their initial PRODiG funding proposal and campus  
PRODiG Implementation Plan, with the goal of periodic (annual, at minimum) assessment and  continuous improvement. The PRODiG Review Committee at SUNY System Administration will  consider campus progress over past years (say 3-4 year rolling average) in achieving stated goals for subsequent funding decisions.  
3. Eligibility 
All state-operated SUNY campuses and community colleges are eligible for PRODiG funding. The  contract colleges are invited to be part of PRODiG with funding provided by the private college or  university in which they reside.  
4. Timeline 
• 2019 Request for Proposals published February 2019 
• University Faculty Senate PRODiG Workshop (March 1-2, 2019, Binghamton University) • Campus proposals due by 5pm ET on July 15, 2019 
• PRODiG Funding Announcement -- August 2019 
• Implementation of Campus Plans begins no later than September 2019 • Rolling Approvals of PRODiG hires starting with AY2020 
• Annual PRODiG Implementation Reports due in March of each year 
• 2020 Request for Proposals published February 2020 
5. Elements of Proposal 
A. Background/Context 
Describe the history and context of your SUNY campus’s current faculty diversity, specifically URM  and WSTEM faculty, and the diversity of the student pipeline into doctoral programs, where  relevant. This should be as specific as possible, not only to the campus, but to programs and  specialty areas within the faculty. Further describe initiatives to develop pipelines to academic 
3 
Updated Guidelines – 6.20.19/p.4 
careers among students, specifically URM and WSTEM students. How is your campus uniquely  challenged, or uniquely well-positioned with respect to diversity within the faculty and the student  pipeline into doctoral programs? How has your campus traditionally approached issues of  diversity and inclusion? Provide some context for the empirical data you will provide. What  background should the review committee have about your campus as it reviews your proposal? 
Additionally, campuses should assess the diversity of the available labor pool of candidates and the historical hiring and retention rates of underrepresented candidates in relation to overall  hiring and retention rates. 
B. Hiring Plan 
Hiring plans submitted for PRODiG funding should align with campus Strategic Diversity &  Inclusion Plans. 
Campuses may consider the utility of cluster hiring in creating their plans. Moreover, cluster hiring  plans will be evaluated for how well they incorporate best practices for cluster hiring to enhance  faculty diversity, supported by documentation. 
C. Faculty Hiring Self-Assessment  
What are your campus’s primary impediments to hiring URM and WSTEM faculty? Support your  conclusions with empirical data. 
Campuses should provide the following faculty diversity data, where available: 
1. A summary of the last 5 years of faculty hiring (by decanal unit, department, STEM  disciplines, other relevant categories), broken down by demographics  
(race/ethnicity/gender/etc.) 
2. Demographic analysis of faculty retention 
a. What was the outcome of the faculty hires? What is the retention rate of each  cohort? If they left the campus, what was the reason given, if any? 
b. How successful was the campus in retaining the faculty members that were hired? 
3. Demographic Step Analysis of faculty hiring over the past year (example of a step analysis) a. Diversity of the available labor pool 
b. Diversity of faculty applicant pools (compared to the diversity of the available labor  pool) 
c. Demographic data on individual(s) selected for Round 1 interviews (define) d. Demographic data on individual(s) selected for Round 2 interviews (define) e. Demographic data on individual(s) selected for Round 3 interviews (if applicable) f. Demographic data on individual(s) given an offer 
g. Demographic data on individual(s) who accepted the offer
4 
Updated Guidelines – 6.20.19/p.5 
4. Visio Flowchart (or similar representation) of campus’s faculty search/hiring, mentoring,  and retention process, highlighting when/where steps are taken to reduce barriers to  diversity (example). 
D. Pipeline Building Plan 
Given the variety of institutions in our comprehensive SUNY system, campuses are expected to  submit pipeline building plans (1) consistent with their unique challenges and opportunities to  contribute to, and build, pipelines to academic careers for URM and WSTEM undergraduates and  graduate students, and (2) emphasizing early talent identification and development (i.e., “recruit  like a coach”). 
Campuses will draw upon institutional data, and their individual campus PRODiG Plan, to itemize  (by department) the number of URM and WSTEM graduate student they expect to matriculate in  2019-20. 
1. Graduate Student Stipends 
These one-time, “top-up” stipends of $5000 each to support incoming PhD students will be  awarded to the graduate school for support of URM and WSTEM graduate students with the  goal supporting a diverse pool of candidates in pursuit of academic careers.  
E. Pipeline Self-Assessment 
Campus should identify, illustrate and evaluate effectiveness of pipelines into academic careers for  URM and WSTEM students at all stages. 
F. Campus Implementation Plan 
The CIP is the document that pulls together all of the above. It should express the campus  strategies for overcoming barriers to faculty diversity and expanding pipelines and pathways into  academic careers for URM and WSTEM students, consistent with the self-assessments. 
1) How does the campus plan to building pipelines, bridges and pathways to academic  careers for URM students and WSTEM disciplines? 
2) How does the campus plan to enhance efforts to reduce barriers to diversity in  faculty, hiring, mentoring and retention? 
3) How do the academic and other units work together to achieve these goals? 4) If numerical goals are contemplated, what basis will the campus use to determine any  participation goals? 
5) If an historical imbalance of URM and WSTEM faculty representation is found to  exist, how does the campus plan to remedy the imbalance? 
6. Time and Place of Submission
5 
Updated Guidelines – 6.20.19/p.6 
• Each campus seeking PRODiG funding must upload a single proposal to PRODiG@suny.edu no later than 5pm ET, July 15, 2019, and address all inquiries to PRODiG@suny.edu 
7. Evaluation Criteria 
Successful proposals will clearly outline how the campus will leverage PRODiG resources  (described in Section 2, Project Goals) to reduce impediments to faculty diversity in the faculty  search/hiring process, and expand the pipeline of talented URM and WSTEM students into  academic careers. 
Successful proposals will, at a minimum, demonstrate the following: 
• Alignment with the campus strategic diversity and inclusion plan; 
• Proposal emerged from a cross-campus, collective conversation among diverse influencers  and leaders about barriers to faculty diversity and robust pathways for talented,  underrepresented students into doctoral programs; 
• Adoption or demonstrated use of creative and innovative approaches to faculty  recruitment, retention, and pipeline building; 
• Thoughtful, probing assessment of the challenges and opportunities for increasing faculty  diversity, increasing student pipelines and pathways into academic careers, and remedying  historical underrepresentation in faculty hiring that is empirically supported by institutional  data; and 
• Composition of the campus PRODiG Committee reflects diversity of perspectives and  representation. 
Proposals will include a work plan indicating the techniques and methodologies planned to meet  program objectives. Campuses should provide documentation that details, chronicles, and supports their methods, analysis and conclusions for each of the elements in the plan. 
All proposal elements, including any requests for funding and proposed actions, shall comply with all  applicable laws and regulations. 
8. Awards 
Disbursement of salary support funds (and the corresponding graduate stipends) will occur on a  rolling, case-by-case basis, once documentation of a confirmed faculty hire is received. Further  details on disbursement will be discussed at the PRODiG Workshop, and included in award  documentation.

SUNY Old Westbury PRODiG Advancement Project 
Executive Summary 
(please see the relevant section in the main document for details and supporting data) 
A. Background/Context - Old Westbury has a strong record of hiring and keeping  underrepresented faculty, but is confronted with a gap between our student and faculty diversity:  the PRODiG goal of doubling our underrepresented faculty would bring our student and faculty  demographics much closer to parity. We have attempted to address reviewer feedback by honing  the context to focus more clearly on unique challenges and opportunities, and by providing  additional demographic context for the MSI-related questions. Our strategies anticipate PRODiG support to improve competitive equity to URM applicants with greater leveraging of  our institutional diversity in the recruitment and hiring process. This faculty salary support will  permit the college to direct other resources to strengthen our hiring practices and ancillary  supports (e.g., course release time), and to institutionalize our plans for faculty mentoring.  
B. Hiring Plan - This section has been revised to provide additional analysis of barriers,  projected targeted objectives, more discussion of WSTEM (continued also under section C) and  data tables that better support our unique characteristics. Old Westbury anticipates at least 12  tenure track searches (replacements - not new lines) over the next three years; we seek to  increase our “yield” of URM and W-STEM faculty from our recent benchmark of 20% of new  hires to 42% (5 of the 12). Additionally, PRODiG support will allow us to target candidates  from diverse professional communities, to improve the diversity in our recruitment pools, which  our past practice has sometimes limited. 
C. Faculty Hiring Self-Assessment – This section has been revised to provide greater depth in  the analysis. Old Westbury’s faculty diversity has plateaued, due to smaller applicant pools, a  spate of failed searches (no offers made) and numerous rejected offers (mostly because of  salary). We will reorganize our faculty searches to improve the evidence-based hiring practice  which includes (1) more intentional use of networks and targeted advertising, (2) a Process Advocate on each search committee, and (3) structured mentoring that initiates during the search. 
D/E. Pipelines – Self-Assessment – Old Westbury serves the pipeline principally at two points – when undergraduate and even high school students begin their academic journeys, and at the  point where newly minted PhD’s become tenure-track faculty – supported to tenure. Increasing  our faculty diversity will help us better prepare URM and W-STEM bachelor’s graduates to  progress to the doctorate. We are part of the Comprehensive Colleges Consortium’s proposal to  nurture recent PhD’s and post-docs guiding them into careers at primarily undergraduate  institutions, like ours. We include two newly hired tenure-track positions that begin this fall for  PRODiG support. 
F. Campus Implementation - Our plans align with our College and Diversity Strategic Plans to  increase student and faculty diversity, as well as with our College Mission, which is described in  greater detail in terms of the implementation. Our PRODiG Committee includes the relevant  campus stakeholders – all of which are committed to the Mission-driven goals of inclusivity,  access, and student success (see Appendix 1 for current PRODiG Committee membership). The  PRODiG Committee will facilitate ongoing assessment and revision of our PRODiG plans.
Old Westbury Executive Summary  
A. Background/Content 
The College at Old Westbury was founded on the ideals of diversity, innovation, and mission  distinctiveness. We continue to grow and to improve the quality and scope of our degree  offerings, while maintaining our identity as one of the most diverse, accessible, and affordable  Liberal Arts Colleges in the nation.i We are diverse in our students, faculty, and professional  staff. The College’s Mission guides us in everything we do: 
SUNY Old Westbury is a dynamic and diverse public liberal arts college that fosters  academic excellence through close interaction among students, faculty and staff. Old  Westbury weaves the values of integrity, community engagement, and global citizenship into  the fabric of its academic programs and campus life. In an environment that cultivates critical  thinking, empathy, creativity and intercultural understanding, we endeavor to stimulate a  passion for learning and a commitment to building a more just and sustainable world. The  College is a community of students, teachers, staff, and alumni bound together in mutual  support, respect, and dedication to the Mission. 
We enact our Mission through our curriculum, programs such as STEP, CSTEP, and EOP, our  commitment to high impact practices (HIPs) like applied/experiential learning (including study  abroad),ii our award-winning First Year Experience and linked CALL (Community Action,  Learning & Leadership) Program, and our Honors College, where we advance student diversity  alongside elevated entrance selectivity standards.iii Our majors and degrees include some type of  applied learning experience in either a capstone course, field placement, formal internship, or  faculty mentored research experience. In STEM and other disciplines, students have the  opportunity to participate in faculty-mentored research as an upper division elective or to engage  in other applied learning experiences through practica or non-credit-bearing research.  
Our Faculty 
Old Westbury’s tenure-stream faculty work within “home departments” within three of our four  schools, the School of Arts & Sciences (SAS), the School of Business (SOB), and the School of  Education (SOE) (the School of Professional Studies (SPS) is not currently home to any full-time  tenure-stream faculty). Table 1 provides the gender breakdown of our race/ethnicity categories,  each academic department’s tenure stream faculty by race/ethnicity and gender; it also identifies  W-STEM faculty, by their race/ethnicity. The distribution of women and URM faculty across  schools results from the demographics of doctoral degrees, national job markets, and – of course  – our hiring practices, our mentoring activity, and our campus environment. With respect to our  campus environment, in a recent survey of tenure-stream (e.g., both tenured and tenure-track)  faculty (n=47, 32.9% response rate), 72.3% of all respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the  climate in their departments was supportive; among URM faculty, that figure was 87.5%. The  same survey found that mentoring activities were more likely to be informal (68% reported  serving as an “informal” mentor for a new faculty member, 25% reported having served as a  “formal” mentor) and about half of respondents disagreed or were neutral about statements about  their departments providing “consistent and effective mentorship” in teaching (49%), service,  (45%), and professional development (55%).  
In this proposal, we therefore focus on improving our hiring practices (in our discussion of the  step analysis data) and our mentoring activities.
Page 1 of 33 
Success rates in recruitment and retention of faculty vary among our academic departments. Our  SOB faculty is by far the least diverse, and we must increase our W-STEM faculty to serve our  high numbers of women in STEM fields (esp. in Biological Sciences). Accordingly, our focus on  improving our faculty search policies and practices is not simply a general plan, but contains  specific responses to the data (see Section B – Hiring Plan). Overall, the diversity of our faculty  has remained high (though we continue to struggle to hire W-STEM faculty), compared to other  similar SUNY (and non-SUNY) colleges. That also suggests that our faculty diversity, while  high, may have plateaued; this proposal will increase the diversity of our faculty.  
Our Students  
Our “demographic shift” in the students we serve has been a shift in scale, not in kind, and we  continue to attract and serve a student population that is the most racially and ethnically diverse  in the SUNY system. Table 2 shows the relative proportion of race/ethnicity categories for the  seven most recent Fall terms. The only significant change has been in the growing proportion of  students who self-identify as “Hispanic.”* Our larger enrollments (from 4422 in Fall 2012, to  5152 in Fall 2018 – a 16.5% increase) have in no way compromised our commitment to student  diversity. 
The profile of our students should not be limited to identity demographics, however. While  some of our students are from outside of NY State and more than 20 foreign countries, in Fall  2018, more than 96% were from the southeast region of NY State (74.9% from Nassau and  Suffolk Counties; 21.9% from New York City). We continue to be a “commuter” school (83.5%  commute) and the majority (61%) of the campus’s residential student population comes from  New York City.** Our commuter and residential populations overlap, but have important  differences: in Fall 2018, Black, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, and Native Hawaiian  students accounted for 84.5% of all residential students, compared to 52.2% among commuter  students.  
Student diversity varies by type of new student. In Table 3, our incoming first-year class in Fall  2018 had higher proportions of students who self-identified as “Black or African American” than  in either the continuing or new transfer student populations. This “shift” is important to note in  two ways. First, because Old Westbury is a Comprehensive College within SUNY, we have as  our two main “feeder” Community Colleges Nassau CC and Suffolk CCC – both of which  reflect the changing demographics of Long Island – they draw few students from New York  City. The second is related to the significant growth in our first-year admissions, and the  increasing proportion of students who began their college careers at Old Westbury. From 2012- 2015, our average incoming Fall First-Year class size was 421 students; from 2016 to 2018, that  number increased from 530 to 669 to 748 – a massive shift in how our students enter the College  (a 77% increase in the first-year class). Because our new first-year students tend to have more  URM students, any sustained growth promises to increase our student diversity. 
The data indicate imbalances we intend to address. The URM student gap between the SAS  (59%) students and SOE (37%) reminds us that we must pay close attention to diversity and  inclusivity in every sector of the College. It is worth noting that, using the proportion of URM    
*although we report to SUNY and IPEDs about our Hispanic students as if they were unable to occupy other racial/ethnic  identities, here – and in the interests of clarity about our student demographics – we include the full range of ethnic and racial  identities that describe our students’ sense of identity 
** Unless otherwise specified, all data contained in this proposal were provided by Old Westbury’s Office of Institutional  Research and Assessment. 
Page 2 of 33 
students as a rough measure, the SOE currently has the “least diverse” student population, but it  has the “most diverse” faculty, with 33% falling into URM race/ethnicity categories. By  contrast, the School of Business (SOB), with 49% of its students self-identifying as URM, has  only 8% URM faculty. This highlights our need to make positive efforts to diversify the SOB  faculty, and the SOE student populations. 
Among SUNY’s comprehensive colleges, SUNY Old Westbury sits near the top of the Social  Mobility Index (SMI) ranking.iv Moreover, US New and World Report identified Old Westbury  for our high percentage of students who go on to graduate school.v We have opportunities to  strategically expand our STEM successes and contribute to the URM and WSTEM pipeline in  STEM fields. In Fall 2018, our STEM major population (e.g., Biological Sciences, Chemistry,  Math, and CIS majors) comprised 871 students, 20% of the undergraduate student body, of  whom 53 % were women (see Table 5, below). Our STEM student population has steadily  increased over the past five years, with the largest increases in Biological Sciences (up 47%, to  487 majors) and in Computer and Information Science (up 82%, to 217 majors) by Fall 2018.  Whereas 48.6% of our undergraduate students receive Pell Grant support, 54% of STEM  students receive Pell Grant support. In light of the need-based indicators for STEM students, the  recent PIF Awards for Applied Learning and Clean Energy Workforce Development will provide  direct stipend support for student research assistants and interns in STEM. This makes it all the  more imperative that we hire W-STEM faculty. 
The College has improved metrics of student success. Over the last five years, our six-year  graduation rate increased from 38% to 48%. The College now provides increased support for  FTC, C/R and TR students, including establishing our Student Success Center (an integrated  student service center that provides academic tutoring and advising, academic success  mentoring/coaching, transfer student services and career planning and development), campus wide use of electronic advising and early alert software (EAB/Navigate), more intrusive advising  and targeted efforts to engage new students and to support completion by continuing students.  Such successes both rely on and perpetuate our long traditions of inclusion, which operationally  show that as diversity increases within the faculty, general support for diversity results.vi Faculty  expertise, scholarship, and teaching – integrated with student engagement – include roughly 20  faculty led curricular/co-curricular entities (Figure 1). These attract and retain faculty, while  providing student mentoring opportunities. 
Faculty Expertise Supports Students in the Pipeline 
As an institution focused on undergraduate education, faculty prioritize teaching excellence,  reinforced by professional development expectations for reappointment, promotion, and tenure.  The result is a faculty made up of “teacher-scholars.” In the natural sciences, faculty focus  largely in biomedical and health-related research, as well as in the pedagogy of science in higher  education, including biophysical studies using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy; genomics/bioinformatics in the areas of comparative developmental biology and plant  proteomics and disease resistance; neuroscience and immunology in the areas of neuro degenerative disease; obesity associated inflammation and cancer immunology; photochemistry  focused on biomolecule sensitizers as chemical therapeutics in cancer treatments and

 other photodynamic therapies. In the Chemistry and Physics Department the faculty capability has recently  been expanded with the addition of faculty with astrophysics expertise. The Biological Sciences Department is  anticipating the addition of a computational biologist within the next year, which will support the department’s  big data curricular degree development plans. In the Mathematics, Computer and Information Science  Department (Math/CIS) expertise in the area of data science has led to a Master’s degree in Data Analytics  which begins this fall 2019. We continue to have difficulty attracting W-STEM faculty at a rate that better  reflects the labor pool. 
Faculty in the Social Sciences, the Humanities, and in the Expressive Arts offer our students significant  expertise in areas including neuropsychology and the social determinants of health and mental health  (Psychology and Public Health Departments); the politics, literature, and culture of the Spanish-speaking world  (Modern Language Department); and the politics, history, culture, and structures of social inequality (PEL,  American Studies, History/Philosophy, and Sociology Departments). Major research areas include the  representations of race, gender, and social class in American and global society; the structures that enable  gendered resistance to workplace oppression; the cultural heritage of race in America – in literature, in slave  narratives, in Native American narratives, in popular culture, and the public media. Inter-departmental groups of  faculty focus on the continuing challenges of immigration – in the present and historically – as well as many  other areas. This broad range of professional work and research production has enabled the successful launch  of the MS in Mental Health Counselling, the MA in Liberal Studies degree, and a nascent program in Applied  Social Research. 
We posit that the relationship between our faculty and student diversity is best understood not as comparative  rates, but as mutually supporting and reinforcing processes, with diversity in one group supporting diversity in  the other. As our survey of tenure-stream faculty shows (see Table 7, below), our student diversity is central to  our appeal in successful faculty hires – our success with URM faculty (and all our faculty) rests on the  opportunity to work, teach, research, and live within a campus community that is inclusive, supportive, and  successful in serving people for whom access to higher education may be their best opportunity to improve life  chances, and to build a better future. We anticipate that as we increase our URM and W-STEM faculty, we will  see an uptick in our students’ success. One of our challenges is to more broadly disseminate and market our  institutional profile.  
The College’s location offers some cost of living challengesvii, while simultaneously attracting diverse faculty,  given its proximity to NYC, with all it offers, as well as the mixed – and increasingly multi-ethnic – surrounding Long Island communities. Additionally, the location provides opportunities for regional inter institutional program collaboration and faculty recruitment. This includes programs that provide Research  Experiences for Undergraduates viii for URM and women in STEM, which strengthen the undergraduate pipeline  segment within this region. Our participation and regional Institutional Research & Academic Career  Development Award (IRACDA) collaborationsix, Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate  (AGEP),xand other similar programsxi , have been pipelines for Old Westbury’s faculty recruitment efforts – we have hired two biologists through our relationship with IRACDA during the past five years, one of whom  was a woman. We are well-positioned to magnify the effects of additional URM and W-STEM faculty.

The campus envisions PRODiG as an  opportunity to address some of the structural and  relational impediments for increasing the  diversity of the faculty.  
The College’s Current Diversity  
Old Westbury has a long tradition of supporting  underrepresented groups – among our students,  our faculty, and our staff. The “gap” between  the percentage of our students (55%, in Fall  2018) and our tenure stream faculty (24%, in  January 2018) who are members of  
underrepresented minorities is a 31% difference  that now represents a baseline metric. We also

conceptualize the gap as a means to benchmark our success thus far in including underrepresented  groups among both our faculty and students. When we compare Old Westbury’s faculty to benchmarks  within higher education (comparing URM representation in the academic fields from which we draw our  faculty – e.g., the labor pool – with our success at recruiting and retaining URM tenure-stream faculty,  see Table 6), we have done well. This comparative measure is the benchmark for our continued  improvement. While Old Westbury has been very successful at recruiting and retaining URM faculty,  PRODiG will allow the College to make faculty more representative of student diversity.

Overarching Hiring Target 
The PRODiG Committee (PC) (Appendix 1) in reviewing the comments and Guidelines for Revising  PRODiG Proposals agreed on the targeted objectives below. The PC has noted several PRODiG related 
SUNY Old Westbury PRODiG Advancement Project, Page 8 of 31 
measurable objectives that will help the campus to meet its strategic goals in this area: 
1. Establish an overall target that is consistent with the College’s current Strategic Plan to  diversify the facultyxii: increase the percentage of URM hires (in accordance with the  Implementation Plan) by 50% from the baselines determined in the step and five year  analyses, which includes concurrent increases in several parameters arising out of the self assessment and step analysis. This is anticipated to produce five (5) PRODiG hires during  this three year implementation. For WSTEM the goal is to at least achieve parity (which  was 43% over the 5-year period), with a focus to improve WSTEM retention and thereby  achieve net gains in WSTEM. From the most recent step analysis, these include such things as  addressing the varied applicant pool size, where the average was roughly 60 applicants; the lack  of diversity in the applicant pools, which ranged from 0% to 10%, with an average of 3% URM;  and the URM-STEM and WSTEM diversity within those respective applicant pools, which on  average were less than 3% and 20%, respectively. Our plans will implement a comprehensive  faculty diversity initiative to improve the faculty culture, to improve the institutional climate, and  to provide the mechanism for continuous increase in faculty diversity.  
2. Improve the institutional alignment of our search processes with evidence-based best  practices across departments and schools in accordance with the High Priority Strategies in  the Campus’ Strategic Plan-Implementation Planxiii: 
o Promote diversity in four-member search committees: Include the broadest  diversity possible within the departmental search committee (perspective, expertise,  ethnicity, etc.); and Expand typical three-member search committee membership by one additional faculty member, a Process Advocatexiv (who will receive additional training on diversity and inclusion), as one means to broaden outreach, promote diversity, monitor the diversity of the applicant pool, improve hiring practices across departments.  Process advocates, will work with the hiring department and search committee members and will leverage their own experiences and diverse networks. For example, there are URM faculty who are PhD Project, Mellon Fellowship, Ford Fellowship, as well as disciplinary and institution-based program alumni. The institution will recognize the Process Advocate as a college service within the tenure review process, as a means also to mitigate the service-related burdens on such faculty.  
o Develop Job Announcements that are more likely to encompass a diverse  assortment of applicants: Include more broadly defined job descriptions (in terms of  applicant qualifications), make better use of institutional cues related to the campus  profile, the faculty (Figure 1) and teaching responsibilities (pedagogy and content),  and include departmental statements involving the commitment to diversity.  
o Promote diversification in the applicant talent pool: Include department faculty in  the efforts to broaden the outreach within their professional networks working with  the Process Advocate and the Human Resources Personnel Associate for Recruitment to provide suggested faculty-related resources (including training workshops), and promote and monitor efforts to diversify and increase the applicant pool.  
o Improve pre-search outreach efforts for hiring process and the timing of the search  process: When possible, begin pre-search process earlier by establishing a diverse search committee roughly 6-10 months prior to the initial employment announcement, providing department faculty with the opportunity to use their respective networks and professional activities to promote, broaden and diversify the applicant talent pool for the search.
SUNY Old Westbury PRODiG Advancement Project, Page 9 of 31 
o Monitor and assess outreach impact for the search: the Process Advocate will assist HR associate and search committees to monitor the impact of the outreach efforts to  diversify the applicant pool, measured against our target goal to increase the percentage  of URM and W-STEM applicants by at least 50% from the current average baselines  identified in the step and five-year analyses. 
o Mitigate any implicit bias in the hiring process: Provide workshop training and other  resources to department faculty as a means to improve the preparations for the hiring  process, the departmental climate and to inoculate the institutional consciousness.  
o Proactively mitigate potential personal and professional impediments in the final  phase of the hiring process: Search committees will encourage their candidates to  advocate for themselves in negotiating the offer: optimizing the offer through release  time, commitment of discretionary funds to support travel, and summer salary support for  research. The Office of Academic Affairs plans to work with the Alumni Association to  identify and develop prospective partnerships with local realtors who specialize in  relocation as an additional support for faculty. Academic Affairs will work on the plan to  restructure the campus’ faculty development grant program as a means to provide some  summer support for faculty research.  
3. Improve the mentorship efforts and institutional climate through leadership  developmentxv: Develop mentoring models that resonate with our Mission to ensure progress  towards tenure.xvi The College values and recognizes faculty work that is equity-driven, as  reflected in the co-curricular scholarly faculty activities in Figure 1 that are supported by  Academic Affairs. The addition of leadership development efforts and the integration of peer  circles with our current model may particularly benefit W-STEM faculty.xvii The W-STEM  members of the PRODiG committee will help assist with the development and assessment of  these mentoring modalities. 
4. Establish baseline data to assist the iterative process for continuous improvement: Revise  application questionnaire to determine effectiveness of outreach efforts and candidate  perspectives of the college. 
Plan 
The Provost assesses the PRODiG Committee’s progress during the formative near-term period to  assure successful implementation within the College’s strategic, diversity, and inclusion plans.  
The PRODiG Committee membership will continue to be representative of strategic operational  stakeholders. The current members during this formative process are the Chair of the Faculty Senate,  one untenured tenure-track URM faculty member, two STEM Department Chairs (W-STEM), the  Personnel Associate for Recruitment, the Deans of the three Schools that house tenure-stream faculty,  the Associate Vice President for Business Affairs and Controller, the Chief Diversity Officer (CDO), the  AVP for Institutional Research and Assessment and the Acting Associate Provost, serving as the Chair  of the PRODiG Committee. 
The low numbers in some departments (and schools) make generalizations difficult, but the Old  Westbury PRODiG Committee, used the step analysis to identify four main areas to improve our  institutional practices: timing, salary, search practices, and mentoring.
SUNY Old Westbury PRODiG Advancement Project, Page 10 of 31 
• Timing: Faculty search processes must align with the schedules and rhythms in the hiring  practices of each discipline. Timing is also important because we need enough lead time for  each search process to ensure that faculty have the time to extend the job posting through their  networks and professional meetings.  
• Salary: Ten of the eleven rejected offers over the last two years were on the basis of salary (see  Table 9). Support for more competitive salaries and related aspects of the offer (e.g., course  release time) are essential to our ability to recruit URM and W-STEM faculty. PRODiG funding  support at the time we were negotiating job offers might very well have resulted in hiring two  additional URM faculty (both African American, one in Sociology, one in Public Health). 
• Search Practices: A much more intentional, focused, and significantly revised process (described below, illustrated in our hiring process proposal visual) includes “Process Advocates,” and integrates a more integrative mentorship model into the hiring process. 
• Mentoring: New faculty need help managing the tensions among personal life, pressures to  publish, significant teaching responsibilities and service expectations. Our mentoring plan  proposes institutional support for mentoring activities, as faculty who are best suited as mentors  are often among the most engaged – and therefore busiest – members of the faculty. Our  mentoring plan includes both general orientation to the College and the new role of full-time  tenure-track faculty members (what we are calling “Transition Mentors”) and specific  mentorship that will begin within the “home” department, with a Faculty Mentor for the first  year. Mentors will advise on the processes of reappointment, promotion, and tenure, and provide  advice and support with the new teaching, service and professional development expectations – and how to manage them effectively. These mentoring circles however will be geared toward  more lateral collegial exchange than the more traditional mentor-mentee models. 
Our diverse populations, geography, Mission, and current strategic plans, mean that every investment  that PRODiG support makes at Old Westbury will likely have a larger impact – a better return on  investment. Our institutional commitment to social justice, which is central to our Mission, connects  directly to the campus’s diverse populations, geography, mentorship efforts and strategic plans, all of  which offer innovative recruitment and retention possibilities for URM and W-STEM faculty and  similar potential to improve the evidence based pedagogies that enhance the pipeline flow of diverse  student populations towards academic careers. One particular strategy to increase diversity (particularly  in STEM) includes recognizing and supporting faculty scholarly activity (including mentorship) that  produces positive diversity related outcomes through synergistic teaching, scholarship and service  activities.xviii In Figure 1, there is the equity-related work of Health Disparities, the UN Project, ISPaD  and NYS RCASD serving as several illustrations. The College will improve its outreach efforts for  URM and W-STEM recruitment in three focused ways: (1) by building on current and new inter institutional collaborations, (2) by supporting outreach through faculty professional networks, and (3) by  strategic proactive pre-search leveraging of search committee process advocate networks and related  targeted marketing efforts.  
The campus may have come to take its faculty diversity for granted, and needs to focus on building and  improving both policies and practices to make data-informed changes that improve our faculty diversity.  This PRODiG proposal provides an opportunity to realign the Campus’s climate and culture with our  Mission. 
SUNY Old Westbury PRODiG Advancement Project, Page 11 of 31 
Projected PRODiG-Supported Hiring 
Beginning in Fall 2019, the College anticipates that we will hire as many as 5-6 new tenure-track  faculty with support from PRODiG funding. This will represent roughly 42-50 percent of the  expected tenure-stream faculty hires over this three year period. Two of these faculty, one URM  and one W-STEM, will begin their tenure track appointments this fall in the Departments of American  Studies and Biological Sciences, respectively. Additionally, the College expects one potential  qualifying hire in the SOB, two in the SAS (one in STEM and one within the Social and Behavioral  Sciences), and one in the SOE (in Literacy). These faculty hires are central to the College’s Strategic  Plan (SP) goals to expand faculty expertise (Goal 2: Promote Academic Excellence & 3: Cultivate  Social Justice & Environmental Responsibility); innovate academic offerings (Goal 2); improve our  diverse and talented student pipeline through strategic enrollment growth (Goal 1: Foster Student  Success); and to enhance overall engagement and support for student success (Goals1, 2, 3 & 4:  Strengthen Institutional Effectiveness).  
PRODiG-Aligned Strategic Diversity and Inclusion Plan 
Our SP aligns neatly with SUNY’s PRODiG goal to increase the diversity of its faculty. One of our four  Strategic Goals of the SP 2018-2023 is to Cultivate Social Justice and Environmental Sustainability.  A key means for achieving this goal is to “sustain and increase the diversity of the faculty and staff.”  The SP Implementation Plan identifies the gradual introduction of several high priority strategies for this  objective to recruit and retain faculty that begin in fall 2019. They include the opportunity for SUNY  Old Westbury to improve its evidence-based hiring practice through the collective efforts of the campus  facilitated by the PRODiG Committee to: 
• Benchmark, assess, disseminate, and discuss an annual report internally both during new faculty  orientation, at full faculty governance meetings, and at Provost’s Council meetings. Such regular  reports on the state of our faculty diversity (nationally and within the region) will aid our efforts to increase faculty diversity on the campus and the efforts to broaden the talent and diversity of  the applicant pool in recruitment. Currently, URM faculty at the College account for 24% (see  Table 6) of the tenure-stream faculty as compared to 16% nationwidexix), and we will continue to  build from there; 
• Improve institutional policies, procedures, and practices to promote and increase diversity  (equitable allocation of release time, travel support), the restructuring of faculty development  grant programs to allow summer salary support, and the institutionalization of faculty mentorship beginning in the search process and extending beyond the first year;  
• Continue to examine hiring patterns to determine diversity “blind spots,” where procedures  constrict the faculty pipeline, and which require changes (e.g., sufficient lead time to support  broader outreach within the search process, intentional inter-institutional recruitment from the  doctoral/post-doctoral URM and W-STEM talent pools within the region, strategic  advertising)xx; 
• Implement more creative and innovative faculty search processes that broaden the talent pool and reduce implicit biases that may occur during the hiring process, including the use of a  Process Advocate described above; 
• Identify non-standard discipline-specific and interdisciplinary recruiting sources that are likely to  enrich the diversity in hiring pools, and that have heretofore been overlooked by the College; • Implement a diversity/inclusion training program for Department Chairs and search committee members. 
SUNY Old Westbury PRODiG Advancement Project, Page 12 of 31 
Another SP 2018-2023 Goal, to Promote Academic Excellence, aligns with and encompasses the  PRODiG-aligned faculty-focused objectives to “enhance faculty effectiveness” and to “showcase  campus as a hub of scholarly and creative activity.” The following high priority strategies are directly  relevant: 
• Increase the ratio of fulltime/adjunct faculty lines with the interrelated focus to increase  extramural funding supports for research and professional development; 
• Actualize a “center” (a centralized community scholarship entity of the campus) that is more  likely to illuminate and support the interdisciplinary research interests/scholarship of the faculty  (see Figure 1), which will position the campus to explore future cluster hires, as an added means to improve faculty diversity.xxi 
The PRODiG Committee will align our College’s Diversity Strategic Plan 2016-2021 (DSP) with our  Campus SP. For example, while the SP addresses the need to build upon the current diversity of the  faculty, the College’s DSP focuses more heavily on PRODiG-related goals that influence the student  pipeline. The two are, of course, intrinsically related. The DSP, for its first objective under Goal #2,  
Create and Maintain a Climate of Respect and Inclusion, addresses faculty and staff training to  supervise and support our diverse student population. The campus over the past three years has  improved its efforts to educate and train faculty and staff to be more mindful of the misconceptions and  biases that can make the campus less receptive to first generation (First Gen) students and students with  disabilities. Seed grants from SUNY’s Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion enabled development of materials and workshops to improve the campus climate for our First Gen students. Similar efforts  resulted in the development of a set of video training materials for faculty and staff to improve  engagement with students with disabilities.xxii These training videos will become part of the new faculty  orientations, as well as part of the online training materials for all faculty, scheduled to be rolled out in  the 2019-20 academic year. 
The PC will work with Human Resources, Academic Departments, Faculty Governance, and the  Diversity & Inclusion Council beginning fall 2019, to buttress the faculty hiring, development, and  retention objectives that are identified under the DSP’s Goal #3, Ensure that Faculty and Staff Hiring  and Retention Processes Support Diversity & Inclusion. While the DSP includes objectives and  strategies of immediate relevance for building the pipeline, there are some faculty-related gaps. In the  faculty survey conducted by our PRODiG Committee, the PC discovered that our faculty respondents  affirm that the campus/department climates are generally respectful and inclusive, but also note that the  faculty mentoring efforts lack the institutionalized qualities that are generally acknowledged to be  crucial to mentoring effectiveness.  
Campus policies for mentoring empowers departments to mentor all new faculty. Department Chairs typically carry out the actual assigning of a department mentor, but implementation has been  inconsistent and lacking assessment. The PC will facilitate and coordinate efforts to make the campus  more intentional in faculty mentorship programs.xxiii We expect that each search committee, led by its  chair, will consult with the relevant department chair to incorporate mentorship for newly hired faculty  members as part of welcoming that faculty member into the department. This early mentoring effort is a  significant strategic diversity element in the hiring plan.  
The PC’s focus in the short term is on several immediate and iterative actions of the hiring plan which  are included in the Implementation Plan section connected with the relevant PRODiG Plan objectives  and timelines:
SUNY Old Westbury PRODiG Advancement Project, Page 13 of 31 
• The Chief Diversity Officer will, in consultation with the PC and the Diversity & Inclusion  Council, work with the Dean of the SAS (in consultation, representing all three schools) to  develop a diversity and inclusion training plan for faculty that codifies existing evidence-based  practice. This training plan will include and/or adapt successful evidence-based models that  build on efforts to inoculate faculty within academic departments (for example against implicit  bias, micro-aggression, micro-inequities, etc.) and improve the climate, as reflected in Goals 2 &  3 of the College’s Strategic Diversity and Inclusion Plan. 
• The Acting Associate Provost and the AVP for Institutional Research (in consultation with the  PC) will work with the HR Personnel Associate for Recruitment to pilot a certification process  based on existing evidence-based practices, including those for STEM.xxiv This will be  coordinated with the work of the CDO and Deans where applicable. 
• The faculty PRODiG members (in consultation with the committee) will work through Faculty  Governance (e.g., with the Faculty Rights and Responsibilities Committee, Faculty University  Awards Committee) and with academic departments to craft a set of principles and standards to  aid the seamless entry, professional development, and benchmarking of tenure-track faculty  through mentorship and advocacy.xxv The Office of the Provost will consult in this effort to  strengthen Faculty Governance in achieving this goal in accordance with the College’s current  Middle States Self-Study Design Institutional Priority to Strengthen faculty governance and its  relationship with the College’s administration for the benefit of students and the broader institution.xxvi 
The PRODiG Committee will continue its charge to advance and assess the PRODiG initiative in five  focus areas:  
(1) New Outreach & Recruitment Efforts. How to establish cost effective recruitment and  outreach to fellowship organizations that specifically focus of diverse groups for academic  careers (e.g., Mellon Mays Fellowship, Ford Foundation, McNair Programs, Woodrow Wilson  Fellowship, etc.);  
(2) New, More Flexible and Responsive Mentorship Models. More formally explore  mentorship models that are available to newly hired faculty beyond our current practice that  largely relies on one-to-one mentoring;xxvii 
(3) Inter-Institutional Collaborations to Expand Recruitment, Mentorship Opportunities &  Professional Development. Explore with regional SUNY institutions opportunities to  establish recruitment and mentoring networks across campuses; 
(4) Faculty Recognition for Diversity Impacts. Explore criteria to recognize faculty for  outstanding service efforts that measurably affect the inclusive excellence of the campus (i.e.  diversity of the pipeline and/or the professional development of peers); 
(5) Leadership Development. Promote, support, recognize and track diversity in the appointment  of URM and WSTEM in leadership positions.  
The Chair of the PRODiG Committee will work with the members to create a timetable beginning fall  2019, to meet with the key stakeholders for the goals and objectives of the SP, DSP and MS Self-Study.  These conversations will provide the opportunity to consult proactively and to share suggestions for  achieving the shared goals and objectives that influence the faculty hiring practices of the campus.  
C. Faculty Hiring Self-Assessment 
As Finlay and McNair (2017) found, Old Westbury has long supported high levels of faculty diversity.  Even as, over the last four years, we have hired many new faculty, we have managed to maintain – and  by small increments, increase – our faculty diversity, from 22.53% to 24.3% of Black, Hispanic, and 
SUNY Old Westbury PRODiG Advancement Project, Page 14 of 31 
Native American tenure-stream faculty. During the same time, our percentage of women in STEM  fields declined, from 41.4% of tenure-stream STEM department faculty in 2016, to only 36.7% in 2019.  Over the last five years, the College has completed 47 hires, which included 14 STEM hires, 6 of whom  were women; of the total 47 hires, 10 (21.3%) were members of underrepresented racial/ethnic groups  (see Table 8).

Our overall retention rate, as of the end of the 2018-2019 academic year, was 87.2% (41 out of 47); for  the same period, our faculty retention among the URM faculty was 100%. Of the six faculty who  resigned their positions at the College, two began their tenure-track appointments in 2014 (one left at the  end of the summer 2017, the other at the end of summer 2018), and four began their tenure-track  appointments in 2015 (one each left at the end of summer 2016 and 2017, and two left at the end of  summer 2018). The reasons these six faculty resigned their positions reinforce the factors we also  identified as concerns in our ability to recruit faculty: four of the six new faculty accepted positions at  other institutions with higher salaries (the other two left for family and personal reasons). Salary is only  one part of the package that we offer prospective faculty, but the economic realities and high cost of  living make it an important component in the constellation of factors that help us to retain faculty.  
Analysis of Recent Hiring – the Steps in the Process 
Our Step Analysis clearly shows that our job postings range all over the calendar – from July to April.  Old Westbury uses “Interview Exchange” as our Human Resources software solution, and our “step analysis” of two years of faculty hiring relies on that data, comprising 24 search processes (for 25 positions), resulting in 17 tenure-track hires. For several of the successful searches, however, our first choice candidates rejected our offer – including three URM faculty (in Sociology, Public Health and  American Studies). These processes followed a sequential multi-step sequence: 
(1) the faculty search committee determines whether each applicant is qualified for the position,  i.e., meets the minimum qualifications as advertised and as described in the paperwork  authorizing the hire process: appropriate credentials, discipline, etc.;  
(2) faculty search committees then evaluate each applicant on the basis of a structured rating  system, again based on the qualifications described in the advertisement to develop a “long  short-list” of applicants who are typically interviewed remotely, either by telephone or  video-conference;  
(3) a short list of the highest-rated applicants are invited for an on-campus interview; and  (4) the Provost presents the College’s job offer to the best applicant from among those who are  invited for a campus visit, if one of these campus interview applicants is deemed suitable.
SUNY Old Westbury PRODiG Advancement Project, Page 15 of 31 
If the offer is rejected, the Provost may, in consultation with the involved department, make an offer to  another applicant from among those brought to campus for an interview. No applicant receives a job offer without an on-campus interview, and the College makes offers only to applicants who  substantively meet the needs of the academic department and the students served by it, as described in  the authorizing paperwork and in the job advertisement, and in the judgment of the faculty search  committee, the departmental faculty, the appropriate Dean, and Academic Affairs. 
During the last three years, the College received 1052 individual applications, conducted phone/video  interviews with 101 applicants, and hosted 54 on-campus visits. We made 22 offers and were able to fill  17 positions, which included one URM faculty member (hired into the American Studies Department)  and one W-STEM faculty member (hired into the Biological Sciences Department).

Our information about offers refused is limited by the nature of the relationship between the applicant and institution under such circumstances. As well as we can discern, the main reason for rejected job  offers had to do with the salary we are able to offer, in the context of the cost of living in the Long  Island region, as Table 9 shows. In some respects, this subgroup is quite similar to the population of  faculty who accepted positions at the College, with 3 (27.3%) of these turn-downs coming from URM  applicants, 3 (27.3%) from applicants in STEM fields, and 4 (36.4%) from women applicants. The  salience of salary for these rejections is important, but cannot be understood in isolation from the  disciplinary areas in which the College received these rejections: six of the eleven rejections were in  highly competitive STEM areas. Still, while some of these refused offers resulted in failed search, it is  worth noting that the refused offer in the American Studies search was ultimately successful, and  resulted in hiring a woman who is a member of a URM group. Our main difficulties in filling tenure  track positions has been in three STEM disciplines: Math/CIS, Biological Sciences, and in Chemistry  and Physics, and two non-STEM disciplines, identified in RED in Table 10.

Faculty Search - Hiring – Mentoring – Retention Processes  
Faculty searches take place in one of three contexts: 
1- a replacement hire (e.g., after a faculty retirement or reassignment) 
2- a new hire to address growth in enrollment in an area (e.g. growth in Biology majors) 3- a new hire to enable new curricular offerings (e.g., a new major, degree program) 
In each situation, the first steps are similar, as involved faculty (e.g., in the hiring department, or those  involved in the specific program in which the new faculty member will teach), the relevant Dean, and  the Provost develop a profile of the specific disciplinary (or interdisciplinary) teaching expectations for  the new hire. The involved faculty take primary responsibility for drafting the position description,  referencing teaching, research, and service responsibilities and expectations, as well as a thumbnail  description of the College; these are typically adapted from the College Mission: 
Below are two samples of departmental language developed for tenure-stream faculty search processes  to help convey the kind of place that Old Westbury is: 
Sociology 
Since its foundation in 1965, SUNY Old Westbury has been committed to social justice, diversity, and the  empowerment of traditionally underserved populations. The College serves a large proportion of non traditional students, and has been ranked among the most diverse liberal arts colleges in the United  States by the US News & World Report for the past 13 years. The campus is situated on 604 wooded  acres on Long Island, twenty miles from Manhattan.  
Public Health 
The salary is competitive and includes excellent benefits. SUNY Old Westbury is a small, diverse public  college with a mission of social justice, situated on 604 wooded acres on Long Island, 22 miles from  Manhattan. 
Beyond these preliminaries, our plan for new tenure-track faculty hires follows the flow described in the  visual (Figure 2, below), with several points at which the search may be aborted if (1) the applicant pool  is too small, (2) insufficiently diverse, or if (3) the process has become flawed or failed to meet the  expectations of an open, inclusive search process. Process Advocates will self-select/be nominated in  cooperation and consultation with their departments, the Dean of their school, HR and Academic  Affairs. They will be trained in best practices, and will exercise their authority only with respect to  process and inclusion, but will not participate in determinations that involve specialized knowledge.  
Similarly, the selection of Transition Mentors and Faculty Mentors will rely upon the experience,  integrity, and training of those faculty colleagues who have completed training and can operate  effectively in interdepartmental relationships. Both will typically come from the ranks of tenured  faculty; they may be from any department, but must exhibit the skills and temperament to welcome new  faculty effectively. These structural support roles, the Process Advocate, Transition Mentor, and  Faculty Mentor, are a PRODiG related synergies for the Strategic Plan.

D. Pipeline Building Plan 
Pipeline Challenges and Opportunities 
SUNY Old Westbury is uniquely positioned to create “watershed” tributaries for URM and W-STEM  student pipelines to the professoriate. The College’s historical Mission features a commitment to educate  “traditionally bypassed” (underserved) students, and it flourishes within the urban and suburban  multicultural and socioeconomic mosaic of the region. Typically, the student enrollments across the  four schools and 17 departments exhibit collective URM populations that exceed 50% of the respective  majors within departments (see Table 11, below).  
According to fall 2018 data, the seven largest departments on the campus in terms of student majors  account for nearly 62% of the overall undergraduate enrollment. Two of these seven departments are  STEM departments, Biological Sciences (BS) and Mathematics, Computer and Information Science  (Math/CIS). The Accounting department, which is among the seven, is recognized as a high need  licensed profession. The URM demographics accounted for 57% of the majors across the seven  departments, 55% in STEM (BS, MA/CS only) and 46% in Accounting. The W-STEM cohort (BS,  MA/CS only) in fall 2017 was 52%. The Psychology department represents the largest concentration of  all student majors, where URM also account for 62% of the department majors. The Bachelor of  Science curriculum in Psychology requires two years, at least 4 courses, from the curriculum for STEM  majors. While the Chemistry and Physics department is the smallest of the STEM departments, its  student populations are 35% URM and 52% W-STEM. 
Notwithstanding, the campus faces challenges when competing for talented faculty, particular URM faculty, who are sought after and can command highly competitive salaries. We support our faculty  recruitment by leveraging our College Mission, our multi-level diversity, campus-based pipeline  programs (e.g., NIH/NIGMS IRACDAxxviii), and career orientations to primarily undergraduate  institutions (PUI). In the case of some emerging fields, such as specializations in computational biology  and other “big data” type fields, however, where such faculty have many viable marketplace options,  these factors are compounded. This can have a related curriculum effect as academic departments  innovate in their curricular offerings and yet have difficulty when seeking to expand the departmental  faculty expertise: it becomes more difficult to offer new and innovative academic programs. Our  enrollment growth in STEM compounds the issues with our aging Natural Science Building. Finally,  there are also the concerns of the current national declining trends in college enrollments. Even in this  context, the College’s considerable strides in retaining and graduating our students, and maintaining our  student diversity would be dramatically improved with PRODiG support. We have “visualized” our  sense of the processes and impediments in Figure 3, below.

Student Access to the Pipeline 
Several pre-collegiate programs contribute to the pipeline. As one example, the Science and Technology  Entry Program (STEP) serves underrepresented minority populations in the local region with innovative STEM enrichments that complement secondary school level curricula. During the past three years, the  STEP segment of the pipeline has advanced 47 URM graduates into colleges and universities, with  roughly one-third on their way to SUNY institutions. Sixty-four percent of these 47 graduates were  destined for STEM majors, with forty percent of this pool also W-STEM.

The College’s Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) serves URM  undergraduates. However, earning a baccalaureate degree does not lead directly to graduate programs  (see figure 3).xxix During the past three years, while many of the 113 students obtaining bachelors 
Page 21 of 31 
degrees with solid academic standing expressed their desire to pursue higher degrees, only 8%  immediately matriculated into degree programs. While a more thorough analysis is required, many  appear to have postponed the graduate school endeavor for economic reasons. The College has  increased its commitment to its pre-collegiate programming as a means to reduce some of the debt  burden that such students face on completing their Bachelor degree. From the perspective of the student  pipeline, EOP, as a tributary of the undergraduate pipeline, represents a kind of “best-practices”  approach to the undergraduate pipeline. The EOP graduation rate consistently exceeds the graduation  rate for non-EOP student population.  
As a result of the College’s 2011 Middle States Self-Study, we raised the selectivity for incoming  freshmen. Two additional structural units, the First Year Experience Program and the Honors College,  were also integrated into our academic programming. These actions both strengthen the pipeline and  provide the means to identify distinct ability early on. The First Year Experience program offers a full  year curriculum, a hybrid learning community structure that “block” schedules no more than 50% of the  course credits for freshmen, and an early applied learning experience as the culminating course of the  program. The Honors College provides enrichments in the form of freshmen- and sophomore-year  honors course sections, at least one additional applied learning experience beyond the first year, co curricular activities that advance student aptitude and career-related interest, and a thesis as the capstone  of the upper division work in the major. Dedicated resources for these educational access programs  provide academic support and enrichment services to students. First Year Program and Honors College  students may also serve as peer mentors/tutors, thereby developing and enriching the pipeline. The  Honors College additionally provides entry to talented rising sophomores who distinguish themselves  through their curricular and co-curricular performance, regardless of their academic performance in high  school – another enrichment of our pipeline. 
The First Year Program, Honors College, and the faculty-led co-curricular programming (see Figure 1)  all support our efforts to identify, engage, and develop our students’ talent in the pipeline at the earliest  opportunity. A major focus for building the pipeline involves the College’s continuous effort to improve  the support for these synergies, recognizing their importance both for faculty professional development  and the faculty-student engagement that is central to student retention, growth, and graduation rate.  Student-related engagement enriches the individual student’s career pursuits and the opportunities both  on and off campus afforded through the co-curricular faculty-led programs. As a result, each student has  the means to shape their unique overall learning experience at the College.  
Collaborative Inter-Institutional Pipeline Building 
The campus is also involved in strategies that impact the pipeline as graduates begin their professional  careers. The Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award provides teaching  opportunities for post-doctoral fellows at the college. Participation in this program produced two tenure  track hires over the past five-year period. One of these two is a W-STEM in biology. The  comprehensive college sector of SUNY has offered a fellowship proposalxxx for consideration by SUNY  PRODiG that features some elements that are similar to the highly successful IRACDA program.  Additionally, the five SUNY institutions on Long Island are in the process of forming a regional  PRODiG consortium to improve the coordination and capacity building efforts to recruit and retain  talented pre-faculty candidates within the region.xxxi

Projected Matriculation by Department including URM/W-STEM Majors  
We expect enrollments to continue to increase. In Table 11 (above) we offer an estimate for our Fall  2019 enrolments, by major based on our Fall 2018 enrollments, and in consideration of our current  freshmen and transfer student orientations and registrations, and projections in general enrollment. 
E. Pipeline Self-Assessment  
Assessing Characteristic Elements of Undergraduate Pipeline Outcomes 
The six-year graduation data for the most recent Fall First-Year entering cohort (see Table 13) illustrates  the unevenness of our graduation rates by race/ethnicity. This only reinforces the potential for  improvement in our graduation rates – most notably among our Hispanic students, who are also our  fastest-growing student demographic (see Table 2).

Assessing Characteristic Elements of the Hiring Pipeline Outcomes 
As noted in the previous section, the current institutional climate and hiring practice have constricted the  pipeline (Figure 3). The Hiring Plan seeks to address these constrictions. PRODiG support provides Old  Westbury with the opportunity to reallocate what would have been resource directed to faculty salaries  to the efforts needed to advance diversity-related objectives within the campus’ strategic plans,  including the structural and relational impediments identified in the Hiring Plan and Pipeline Building  sections of this proposal. The College is committed to implementing these changes to address its two  main contributions to the pipeline (undergraduate success for graduate school entry and faculty diversity  in recruitment and retention). With respect to the undergraduate pipeline, this will include assessment of  our initiatives going forward. This will entail ongoing monitoring of the traditional metrics (graduation  rates, retention rates, credits at graduation, etc.), as well as the ones in this PRODiG proposal. We plan to assess race/ethnicity and gender demographics – where feasible – within our academic assessment  program, which is under revision.

*https://news.yahoo.com/news/10-colleges-lead-graduate-school-141435342.html. College has witnessed some changes in the high (79%)  graduate school enrollment rate. However, the patterns for URM in STEM, WSTEM and licensed professions require some additional study.  For example, the past three years of CSTEP data show that most of its graduates postponed immediate entry to graduate programs. Roughly  8% of the graduates immediate went on to graduate school, while another 23% desired to attend graduate school but delayed that plan beyond  1 year for personal and financial reasons, with the remaining graduates testing the job market.

F. Campus Implementation Plan 
Strategies for overcoming barriers to faculty diversity 
Set Institutional Goals.  
The College has set a goal that at least 42% of the projected 12 tenure-track faculty hires over the near  term (including two qualifying hires for fall 2019-20) will be URM or W-STEM. This goal represents a  50% increase over the baseline determined through the 5 year self-analysis (Table 8), which identified  21% URM (and 43% WSTEM) rate over that period. The WSTEM goal focuses on the institutional  climate and faculty culture to improve the retention rate for WSTEM. These are substantial goals. The  potential exists for even broader impacts.  
Within the School of Business, the potential for the three faculty hires during the near term could  increase SOB URM faculty from 8% to as much as 20%. The 7-8 prospective faculty hires in the  School of Arts and Sciences offer the potential to increase URM diversity from 27% to roughly 33%.  The School of Education, with its pending hire for 2020-21 has the potential to increase URM diversity  from 33% to 38%. Table 14 specifies the projected timeline.

Leveraging existing faculty diversity & diversity-related activities. 
Institutional Diversity Cues in the Announcement. The College will improve the “diversity” cues in  its faculty job postings. For example, in the SAS, the highest proportion of URM tenure-stream faculty  are in the Modern Languages Department with 60% URM faculty. Modern Languages “indicates  diversity” in its curricular focus and in its “subfield” curricular offerings.xxxii This aligns diversity focused scholarship with teaching and service (Modern Languages faculty service opportunities include  operating the Hispanic/Latino Cultural Center). Our plan will leverage such curricular cues in our  position postings. 
With respect to URM in STEM and W-STEM, the diversity within STEM departments ranges greatly  (see Table 1) – again, small numbers, which will translate into potentially large percentage increases  with even one new hire. The curricular diversity cues for these departments in announcements are likely  to make reference to equity focused areas of faculty research, the faculty led research institutes and  programs. 
Greater Emphasis on Diversity within the Search. (see Section B, p. 9) 
Equity considerations within the search. This need is very clear from our self-analysis, where for  example, the URM diversity within our applicant pools for our recent hires varied from 0 to 10%, where  these percentages could not be favorably benchmarked to national and regional data. The analysis was  particular disconcerting for URM in STEM and W-STEM. The inclusion of a Process Advocate is one  of the tools to be implemented beginning this fall 2019 to begin to address this self-assessed  observation.  
Broadening the Outreach of the search. Our analysis demonstrates the need for a broader and more  targeted outreach to diverse professional communities. This broadened focus on diverse groups for  academic careers (e.g., Mellon Mays Fellowship, Ford Foundation, McNair Programs, Woodrow Wilson  Fellowship, etc.) will rely on the collective efforts of the search committee (including the Process  Advocate), but also the department faculty. This outreach will begin prior to the search and will  continue through the closing date of the application process. 
Improve Faculty Mentoring. In addition to implementing the Process Advocate, and the Transition and  Initial Faculty Mentor roles, the PRODiG Committee will work with Faculty Governance and academic  departments to craft a set of principles and standards to aid the seamless entry, professional  development, and benchmarking of tenure track faculty through mentorship and advocacy. The Office  of the Provost will consult in this effort to strengthen Faculty Governance in achieving this goal in  accordance with the College’s current Middle States Self-Study Design Institutional Priority to  strengthen faculty governance and its relationship with the College’s administration for the benefit of  students and the broader institution. 
Inter-institutional Collaboration and Other Intra-institutional Pipelines. The self-assessment  process revealed that department diversity has been expanded in several departments by cultivating non tenure stream URM/W-STEM full time faculty. The PRODiG Committee intends to develop a plan to  consider URM/W-STEM when allocating non-tenure-stream full-time positions that have good  likelihood to lead to full-time tenure track entry. Additionally, there are regional inter-institutional  collaborations that remain somewhat untapped (e.g., with the Regional IRACDA network).
SUNY Old Westbury PRODiG Advancement Project, Page 26 of 31 
Improving the Culture and Climate 
It is also clear that the efforts to increase the diversity of the faculty will largely be led by departments,  as faculty candidates typically spend their professional lives within department cultures.  
Diversity Training. The Chief Diversity Officer (CDO), in consultation with the committee and the  Diversity & Inclusion Council, will work with the Dean of the SAS (representing all three schools) to  develop a diversity and inclusion training plan for faculty that operationally builds on existing best  practice and codifies evidenced-based inclusive practices. Additionally, this training plan will  formatively include and/or adapt successful evidence-based models that build on efforts to inoculate  faculty within academic departments (for example against implicit bias, micro-aggression, micro inequities, etc.) and to improve the climate, as reflected in Goals 2 & 3 of the College’s Strategic  Diversity and Inclusion Plan. The CDO will work with the Dean of the SAS to formatively implement a  diversity/inclusion training program for Department Chairs and search committee members.  
Strategies for overcoming barriers to student diversity 
The College has seen considerable success in its graduation outcomes for URM, largely due to transfer  student completions. There are a number of social, economic and cultural barriers that the college  continues to address particularly for URM in STEM and W-STEM students. One illustration of this is in  the manner in which EOP student services are addressed, where our practice has largely isolated this  population from the types of community building and mainstreaming that happens with other  populations. Specifically, there are several things to implement with this study population. The  opportunity to have peer tutors from the Honors College serve EOP has seldom occurred, where the  focus has been to almost exclusively use EOP peer role models to serve EOP students. The EOP  summer program has historically addressed student skills and knowledge gaps through very traditional  pedagogy that has only marginally included active learning pedagogies like inquiry-based and applied  learning. The prospect exists here to expand the opportunities for EOP and CSTEP students to  participate in early applied learning credit-bearing experiences by revising the summer program and its  complementary coordination with the first-year curriculum. These can be strategically used to support  and advance the aptitude and interest of URM and W-STEM during these bridging summer programs.  EOP piloted this in Summer 2019, where the one credit course applied learning CL 1000 course was  specifically designed by an interdisciplinary instructional group for the EOP summer program. 
Similarly, the Honors College has built a strong social and cultural community using co-curricular  activities – a model we intend to replicate more broadly. For example, the various access and pipeline  programs, College Readiness and Pipeline Programs, STEP, EOP, CSTEP, MERIT operate largely in  isolation one from another. We have only begun to explore the possibilities for both additive and  geometric benefits. While the College Readiness and Pipeline Programs have aided a large number of  URM students at the secondary level to experience early college support and success at little or no debt  burden to these students, these curricular activities are seldom leveraged to illuminate seamless  pathways to college degree programs supported by EOP, CSTEP and the Honors College. The Provost  will convene a semi-annual meeting of these programs and establish an academic advisory group  comprised of representatives of these programs to aid the Teaching and Learning Resources Committee  of faculty governance in planning its activities and priorities each year. 
The concerted effort to leverage the existing diversity of SUNY Old Westbury’s student body, as  SUNY’s equivalent of a “HBCU”, and which also impact URM/W-STEMxxxiii in particular, can be  summarized by following strategies that will be formatively implemented beginning this academic year: 
SUNY Old Westbury PRODiG Advancement Project, Page 27 of 31 
(1) provide students, particularly in existing access programs, with early curricular experiences  that promote their aptitude, interests and early college success, by incorporating more HIP  evidence-based pedagogies such as credit-bearing applied learning in pre-freshman summer  bridging programs (e.g., specially designed CL 1000, Community Learning courses);  
(2) use pre-freshman summer experiences and the first year curricular experiences to leverage  our faculty diversity through student-faculty engagements with diverse faculty with related  supports associated with the lower student-faculty ratios of the freshmen and linked entry level courses to majors during the first yearxxxiv;  
(3) codify mechanisms that lead to the replication of impactful evidence-based practices across  the campus by forming new intra-campus alliances that more directly connect with faculty  governance efforts to improve teaching practice;  
(4) improve the student-faculty engagements for research and other applied learning forms by  increasing the structural diversity among the faculty by cultivating the full time contingent  faculty pool as a pipeline to the tenure stream;  
(5) use shared resources where applicable to replicate existing successful community-building  models on the campus (e.g., Honors College) that improve the peer-related climate impacts  for social and cultural identity integrations, and individual persistence, which also mitigate  other psychological climate barrier; and 
(6) expand the scope of mentoring activities through peer and professional staffing both within  the campus’ Student Success Center but also across the campus, such as collaborative  curricular assignments that include professional staffers where possible.  
Some of these strategies are at various levels of implementation. The PRODiG committee (with its  inter-divisional representation) will evaluate and facilitate with the support of Academic Affairs, Human Resources, Student Affairs, Business and Finance and faculty governance, the faculty and the student  PRODiG related strategies. The progress will be included in the annual reporting from the PRODiG  committee.
