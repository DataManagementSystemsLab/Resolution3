Faculty expressed concerns about understanding the scope of the Presidential committees, and how much of the committees’ charges are intended to be tackled this semester, as well as asking for clarification about which committees will be held remotely.  EC has been working through weekends to coordinate this outreach to faculty.  I requested the deadline be extended until next Thursday Oct 28th so the EC can compile the results in our usual meeting next Friday.  President Sams will comment on whether this request is granted.
