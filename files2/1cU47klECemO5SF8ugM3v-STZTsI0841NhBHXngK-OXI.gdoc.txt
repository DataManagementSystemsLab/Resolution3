Hi all,


As you may know, the call for nominations for Faculty Governance Committees came out not too long ago. (Many thanks to Werner Sbaschnik and the Nominations & Elections Committee.)  As a follow-up to the terrific presentations at the last full faculty meeting, I am inviting all faculty members that are able to find at least one position to run for this year and to nominate at least one colleague. Let’s make this the most successful election in OW history! We need you!


Here is the link to the nominations ballot. It is also attached.
