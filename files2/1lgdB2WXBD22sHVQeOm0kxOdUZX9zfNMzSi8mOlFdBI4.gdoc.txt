3. Faculty Senate Chair’s Report                 
* Bylaws revision
   * We will get feedback to the bylaws revision group soon.  We intend to have this ready by the end of the semester.  This is crucial for the new strategic planning and budget initiatives.  This is a specific plan to incorporate strategic planning and budget planning committee by the end of the semester.  There are larger changes planned for later.
* Response to Middle State visit report 
   * We are replying to the collegial advice and the recommendations particularly on the issue of assessment.  Thanks to the Executive Committee for generating some responses and RFPs to submit to Middle States.  Thanks to Mike Kinane on the assessment of SPAAR.  Thanks to the Provost and the President as well as the new staff.
* Faculty governance & academic assessment
   * Governance will play a more active and structured role, not to hinder of course but to help.  We can play an active role to improvement for assessment.  There will be a structure created within governance, more later.
* Taskforce on distance learning and strengthening full-time faculty
   * These are new task forces.  We will have more to say by the end of the semester.
* NYS budget/stimulus
   * It is favorable. We continue to work on finding aspects to benefit our campus.  There is money for capital improvement.  We should pay attention to this and the Science Building.  We are building up the muscles for the Budget planning committee (BPC).  We need involvement in faculty who are knowledgeable about this topic.
* PRODiG committee
   * This will be formalized.
* Fall 2021
   * We will have an info Q&A session during the “if needed” meeting that was originally scheduled at the end of the semester.
* UFS plenary is soon.  There is an email from our UFS senator L. Morris regarding budget news.
* Old Westbury is a vaccination center, more than 1000 people per day and this will continue to increase.  Congratulations.


4. President's Report                                                
* NYS budget
   * SUNY is trying to get flexibility to use stimulus funding, due to loss of 5%. Tap gap will be eliminated by 2025 which will reduce burdens.  EOP got 20% increase in funding.  Capital investments increased.  Student mental health funds were restored.  There are more details in a larger document.  We fared well this budget cycle.
* Marijuana 
   * NY approved usage for select populations.  It does not apply to SUNY and CUNY schools that use federal funds.  Use is still prohibited on our campus.
* Vaccinations
   * We have a goal to vaccinate as many students as we can by the Fall semester.  Our campus will vaccinate our students, as well as will Farmingdale.  Beginning Monday we expect to vaccinate 600 students per week.  That’s enough to vaccinate every student before Fall 2021.
* Athletics and visitors to athletics contests
   * We are in the Skyline conference with Farmingdale and Purchase.  Commencement planning is a variety on different campuses.  This brings up questions about why folks cannot attend athletic contests.  We are working on this issue.  Parents want to attend the athletic contests, there will be more on this soon.
* Middle states
   * Performance plan to budget design.  We are crafting our response to the collegial advice and the recommendations.  We sent out RFPs that are designed to respond to the deliverables, this is due today.  Our plan and the RFPs will be used to craft our response to Middle States next week. By the 23rd we will have completed the draft, which is due on the 27th.  We take seriously Middle States responses, we will indicate that we are ready to reply.  Our response will not just be general, it will be a full-throated plan.
* Question from faculty regarding record-keeping.  There was instruction from SUNY regarding this, such as information recorded out of Blackboard.  We will look into this and revisit it.  All faculty are encouraged to maintaining archives for possible future audit.
* Comment from faculty about Science Building renovations, we hope for a one-phane construction instead of two-phase.
* Question from faculty about Middle States, and whether we can include attention to the mission and vision.  As we create the new strategic plan, yes, we will include the vision and mission, it is an opportunity.


5. Provost’s Report                                                 
* SUNY announcement: congrats to Fred Millan to Distinguished Service Professor.
* New PRODiG members, congratulations!  Angel Lara, Kinning Poon, Shebuti Rayana
* SUNY Chancellor’s award, congratulations! Student Excellence: Kalief Mattelus, Keana Lee
* Honors convocation is a virtual event.  Faculty marshals will be recorded, contact Ozgur Akgun at akguno@oldwestbury.edu.
* Regarding DSI, there are two components: compression/equity, and merit.  Neither of these pots are large.  For the compression/equity component, there are regression equations including time at rank, service time, etc. that generates these amounts.  For the merit part, if you did not submit an annual report you were excluded.  Middle states institutional priorities and the strategic plan in appreciation of service, scholarship, and teaching.  DSI is not the appropriate mechanism, given the size of the pool, to deal with addressing the types of ongoing compensation concerns that have been expressed by faculty. The full faculty task force is also working on including some of these issues too.  Please stand by on this issue, we will update you as we go forward.
* SUNY and UUP have worked out an opt-out model for one-year-to-tenure review which will now also apply for the current year.  You will receive more details.
* Thanks for all the work on the Middle States response. 
* We are looking to reinvigorate faculty development grants.  More details to follow at a later time.


6. UUP Report                                                        
* The updated campus salary report is available at the library circulation desk.  It is public information.  The report is specific for Old Westbury.  The report reflects the recent DSI amounts and also compression amounts.  This is not confidential information.
* Thurs April 15th at 2:30pm:  monthly adjunct meeting.  Any UUP member can attend.
* General membership meeting: Wed April 21 at 2:40pm.  All UUP members are welcome to attend.
* UUP Chapter elections are in progress. You got ballots in the mail.  See the date specified in the instructions for the ballot deadline.  The stated deadline is the “received by” deadline , not the “mail by” deadline.  Write-ins are also possible.
* We are stronger when members participate.
* There is concern about enrollment for Fall 2021 and future semesters.  Such pains are also SUNY-wide.  The new budget was recently published.  Let’s work as hard as we can to have as robust an enrollment as we can.
* Encourage everyone to be vaccinated.  We are all in this together.


7. SGA Report
