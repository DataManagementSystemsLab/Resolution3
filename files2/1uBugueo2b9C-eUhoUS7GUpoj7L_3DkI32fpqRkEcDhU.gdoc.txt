Learning Activities
* Discussions    
Discussions are important to include learner-to-learner interaction, which is required for a course to be considered a distance learning course instead of a correspondence course. Students will also feel a sense of community in the course with their cohort, and will be able to interact with each other to collaborate and share ideas about the topics they are learning. Opportunities for student to student interaction should be included when possible given the absence of “traditional” face to face interaction students may be used to in the classroom. It is important to pace discussions to ensure turn-taking within the conversation. For example, students will participate in online discussions by creating original posts with at least one citation and three responses to other student posts. Remove this text and add your own here. (Aligns with OSCQR standard 5.41, 5.42, 5.43)
* Journals
Journal entries are important for student self-reflection, which encourages deeper learning. Writing is a form of thinking and students writing about their experiences in learning helps them understand how to synthesize information more effectively in the future. It also provides a way for students to take risks and question their thinking. Remove this text and add your own here. (Aligns with OSCQR standard 5.47)
* Assignments/Projects
Assignments and projects that students can complete in their own time while referencing course materials are important for measuring learning. Students should be able to synthesize their readings, lectures, and other course content, and create a product that demonstrates their level of mastery with the material. Remove this text and add your own here. (Aligns with OSCQR standard 5.45)
* Readings/Lectures    
Student-Content interaction is important for online courses so students are able to understand information and actively learn on their own. This is the source of the information they might be talking about in their discussions, utilizing in assignments, and being measured on in assessments. Remove this text and add your own here.
* Quizzes/Tests/Assessments    
Assessing work is important to understand the progress students are making and if they are learning the material. Quizzes/Tests/Assessments measure student learning and can inform future teaching. Quizzes/Tests/Assessments can also be used as formative assessments (i.e. self-checks). Remove this text and add your own here. (Aligns with OSCQR standard 5.45)
