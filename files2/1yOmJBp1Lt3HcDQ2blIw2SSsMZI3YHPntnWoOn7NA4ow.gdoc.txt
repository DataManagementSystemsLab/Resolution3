FS CHAIR REPORT
12/10/2021




SAS Dean Search
* The Provost chose Manya Mascareno from PRODIG to serve on the search committee.
* The Executive Committee (EC) and Manya agreed for her to serve as the faculty governance representative on the search committee
* EC of course agreed that Manya is a great representative for faculty governance, but EC relayed feedback about the process of selection to the Provost.  The ability to choose faculty governance representatives should lie with faculty governance. 
* The Provost agreed that the process was flawed and moving forward governance should choose its representatives.
* The Provost can provide more details about the search, the timelines, etc. in his report.


Hanover Updates
* The Enrollment Project was given the green light from the Cabinet to begin.
* The survey will be sent out soon, in December or latest early January.
* Faculty will eventually see enrollment survey results in the Hanover dashboards.
* To get your faculty access to Hanover Research dashboards, contact Lisandra Ramos at ramosl@oldwestbury.edu.
* The Provost Council meeting Dec 15th will include information about how the Academic Portfolio Optimization and Program Assessment projects from Hanover could be formulated at OW (purpose, goals, etc.).  It’s important to understand that Hanover works at the direction of the college, so we can formulate the questions and the project for them to do.


Residential College Model Updates
* The Cabinet discussed whether the terminology could be updated to be more reflective of inclusivity of commuter students, suggestion that Presidential Committees (PCs) should consider this question.
* PCs may also consider creating a process for proposing cohorts.  For example, faculty wanting to create a cohort could file a proposal, but the process still needs to be set up and discussed.
* Jennie met with Claudia Andrade to discuss Student Affairs (SA) collaborating more with faculty to support faculty projects.  SA can assist faculty with advertising events and food too, faculty should be aware of potential collaboration with SA to get more broad audience for their events and workshops.  Contact Claudia if you would like to discuss more about any project you may wish to seek support from SA.


At Cabinet, Chief Sienna gave a summary about new License Plate Readers (LPRs) on campus.  He will report later today.


The inauguration event for President Sams is being planned.  This event is traditionally/historically also related to concurrent fundraising events for a new President, and the College Foundation is working to organize these event(s).


NSB Renovations Update
* Pres. Sams contacted Malatras, but as we know things have changed recently with Malatras being in the news and resigning.  President Sams will address this.




Please attend great workshop coming up!
