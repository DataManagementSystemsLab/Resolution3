Presidential Committees (PCs) - check website for minutes, updates on Fridays
* https://www.oldwestbury.edu/office-president/presidential-committees 
* President agreed that PCs can report to Senate in April/May, but remember presentations to Senate don’t need to be big and elaborate!  Short reports, 1-2 minutes, no slides needed.  Jennie will be reaching out to PC chairs to schedule a report.  Even better, Chairs just let me know when would be best.


Participation in Faculty Governance
Remember that a Senator's role includes gathering concerns and questions from their departments or constituencies.  If you see an issue, speak up, faculty governance works when we all contribute!  Contact me, we can speak in confidence or with other faculty, whatever you think is best.  CHECK OUT THE NEW SUGGESTION BOX on the FS Website!
