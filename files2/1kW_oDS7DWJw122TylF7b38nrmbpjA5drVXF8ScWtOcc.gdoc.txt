   * If there is a one-off instance where we need to meet with a student on campus, what should we do since our offices are not built for social distancing?  Randomly walk around and find a classroom?
   * Last semester students with bursar holds who didn’t have computers could drop into a computer lab on campus, is this still possible?

   * Will there be assistance for adjunct professors who may need to upgrade their computers because their current technology does not have the hardware/software capabilities to teach synchronously? Are there loaner laptops available for adjuncts?
   * Will students, particularly the incoming Freshmen, be taught the basics of Blackboard before they are expected to join their professors online using the Blackboard Platform?
   * Need more information about getting help from IT.  Is there an emergency procedure for when we are trying to get online for or are mid-class? 
   * Will it be possible to have in person/on campus visit for laptop issues following prescribed COVID pre-screening?
   * Many of us plan to use ZOOM along with Blackboard.  For example, this faculty meeting is being conducted on ZOOM. Will some kind of help(if not training)  for questions about hosting ZOOM and coordinating ZOOM and Blackboard? ---We want to teach the First-Year Seminar, Ethics of Engagement, synchronously, at least one meeting a week. The diversity of the OW community is not just a demographic to us, but part of the anti-racist Community building subject of the class. Without students being able to see each other, hear each other and break out effectively into small groups this will not happen. We tried the other platforms in the spring and they were just not effective in this regard.

Mental Health counselling services contact should be disseminated to students through various social media platforms.
Answer to the above question (by Oren Shefet): Mental Health counseling services are available to all students throughout the pandemic crisis, via telehealth (phone and video-chats). Our services have been advertised on all orientations, a blurb about them will be sent to be added to all syllabus, and emailing to all students is planned once the school year commences. 
Thanks. Oren.  It is very essential for confidential counseling servce
7. IT issues:
                                
   *  Written instructions for the following:
      1. How to access help from IT when there are immediate problems/issues regarding delivery of curriculum or virtual classrooms etc
      2. In order to use some of the available resources, we need to have Windows 10 on our computers.  Some of us do not have that.  How would we get that on our computers? Can that be done virtually? I ask this because I continually get the message that I do not have Admin permission to download the program on my office computer.  How is that being handled?
      3. How do we find out what programs (such as SPSS, Atlas Ti etc) are available?  Where is that listing? How do we access it and who do we contact in order to use some of those programs?
      4. What are the various trainings that will be available for faculty and students to use IT (such as Bb etc.)
