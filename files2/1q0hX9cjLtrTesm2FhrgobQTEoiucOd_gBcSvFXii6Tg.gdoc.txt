Regarding holding Senate and Faculty meetings as hybrid
* I think we will always need a remote component for Senate and Faculty meetings, given the record high attendance we have achieved through the pandemic.
* I am hesitant to have an in-person component to the meetings if only 2-3 people are attending in-person, but if there is substantial enough interest to have an in-person component we can certainly do it with enough advance planning and sufficient in-person RSVPs.  Again, contact me if you want an in-person component so I am aware of the need/desire for in-person option.


Blue software for Course Feedback Forms
* The Provost requested we revisit the software choice, given Blue is higher end, but we don’t use its more advanced features.
* A previous group including faculty already previously established comparison criteria for software such as including ADA compliance, maintenance needs, email and communication capabiliities, compatibility with mobile devices, LMS integration, ease of use, support and training offered, cost, etc. etc.. 
* Academic Affairs will go ahead and compare software options according to the previously-established criteria that was already developed in consultation with faculty.
* The software comparison will be brought back to the Senate before any changes are made.
* The Blue software contract ends around August so we can anticipate a change soon, and the Provost will let us know more info in the near future.


As part of my Blue software outreach to faculty, I discovered some faculty are interested to get together a committee based on (not the software but) the more substantive issues related to Course Feedback such as instrument design, inherent biases, and other broader data collection questions.  Since I have been at Old Westbury, such issues have been discussed by faculty periodically, it is perhaps time for a proper committee to consider these issues.  Currently a group of faculty may be convening in order to write a resolution to create such committee, if you are interested in connecting with those faculty let me know and I will get you in touch.


Hanover
* Feedback was used to update project drafts.
* EC will have a meeting with Hanover soon to get project next steps.
* More updates will be available as soon as we can.


Presidential Committees (PCs)
* Finalized membership lists are available on the President’s website  ​​https://www.oldwestbury.edu/office-president/presidential-committees 
* President’s Office agreed to post minutes/documents for Presidential Committees, those will be available on the President’s website as soon as they are approved/verified
* In an attempt to get the committees going, and reduce the concern about workload, President Sams has asked each committee to identify a main objective for this semester.


New PRODIG Appointments
* New appointments:  Fred Millan, Jasmine Mitchell, Laurette Morris
* Other current members:  Lorenz Neuwirth, Deepa Jani, Zulema Cabail


One Vacancy on Nominations & Elections Committee
* Contact me if interested.
* The committee should have 3 members. 
* Responsibilities for the committee include conducting faculty elections this semester.
* Current members:  Werner Sbaschnik and Fred Millan. 
* Perhaps someone from SOB would be interested?
* Perhaps someone who is familiar with the history of Nominations and Elections?


Don’t hesitate to contact me with questions, if you think some issue should come to the Senate or if there are topics of concern.  Remember that any faculty member or Senate member or committee or Department can submit a resolution to the Senate.   The Executive Committee and FS Chair can help with procedural questions and we can help to connect interested folks with common interests.
