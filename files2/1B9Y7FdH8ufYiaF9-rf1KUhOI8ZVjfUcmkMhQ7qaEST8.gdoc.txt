 III.        FS Chair’s Report 


1. Election for Faculty Senate Chair: Andrew Mattson was elected to serve for the remainder of the 2017-2018 term at the Senate meeting on February 9, 2018.
2. Proposed Graduation Move to Nassau Coliseum: 
      * College was still in negotiations as of 2/5.
      * Cooperation with NCC required immediate EC approval to Provost on 2/5.  Approval given by three EC members present. 
      * Tentative plan: Single Commencement: 9:00 – 11:30 (NCC: 3:00 PM), 10 tickets instead of four?  10k instead of 4k? (17K capacity.) 
      * Rain or shine. 
3. Strategic Plan Update:  Revisions in response to comments received on 11/28 draft have been made.  The revised plan will be submitted by The Strategic Planning co-chairs to the Office of the President in March. Questions should be sent to Co-Chairs of the Planning Process: Anthony Barbara, Duncan Quarless, Andrew Mattson.
4. Updating ARPT Manual, Proposal Approved by EC:  The chair of ARPT Chris Hobson submitted a proposal to review and update the 2003 ARPT Manual to reflect current committee practices. The Executive Committee approved this proposal. The Provost has approved one course release for Chris Hobson for this update of the ARPT manual.   The manual will be revised over the summer of 2018 and submitted to ARPT for review and approval in the fall.  ARPT approved revision will be submitted to the Senate at the beginning of the spring term of 2019 for appropriate action.
5. Request for Consideration of the Faculty Role in Student Conduct Hearings. Ombudsperson?
   * A request for discussion with the faculty to clarify the role of faculty in this process.  One proposal would be to consider an Ombudsperson (Purchase, Stony Brook have such a person.)
6. President of the University Faculty Senate Coming to Old Westbury: Dr. Gwen Kay has asked to visit on either March 12th or 13th.  The EC is making plans.  If anyone is interested in meeting with Dr. Kay please contact the University Faculty Senator Dr. Laurie Morris.


IV.          President’s Report


* Dr. Butts is sick.  The Provost reads topics from notes from Dr. Butts.
* Dr. Butts thanks faculty for the work they do.
* Dr. Butts has just come back from Cuba.  Old Westbury established collaborations with a university there.  Prof. Madurka has participated in a program.
* The state budget has a gap of billions of dollars.  There will be an impact on all the colleges.  Budget bills are being prepared.  We will get a better picture soon.  A flat budget really hurts us, but enrollment jumps do help us.  Our enrollment growth was recently 9% that caused a lot of problems (normal enrollment growth is 2-3%).
* The Strategic Plan (SP) is progressing.  Anthony Barbera reports that the revised SP in March will go to Dr. Butts and it will incorporate comments from the November draft.  Dr. Butts will present it at a town hall meeting in April.
* Academic collaborations are being investigated, for medical programs at Downstate.  Some examples include joint medical programs such as BS MD, BS PA, and some others.  Nancy Brown and staff are looking at collaborating with Westchester CC to offer classes there.  They have a large population of underrepresented students.  Nancy Brown is collaborating with Farmingdale for language pathology, and technology education that involves getting teaching credentials and health profession credentials.  
* Regarding campus parking, peak periods are wed/mon mornings.  We want to grow the enrollment, and we need the revenue.  The issue is very stressful.  We are doing our best.  Steve Sienna reports the 2nd week of this term was the week of greatest demand, and since then the demand has been declining.  Parking will be available, even if not convenient.  Faculty comments that we want designated faculty and staff parking.  The union and faculty have spoken with the administration about the parking.  Faculty comments that some faculty do not support designated spaces.  Faculty comments that we asked for budget information about the parking ticket revenues.  We did not receive that information.  The Provost comments that this is handled by Business, and the money supports parking and other services on campus.  Minna Barrett requests that every penny be recorded and provided to the faculty.
* Commencement will be shared with Nassau CC.  Our ceremony will be in the morning, and theirs in the afternoon.  Faculty expresses concern about commencement reception (no on-site reception).  This is the one downside to the location.  We should consider reception on campus or the day before on campus.  Yes, the Provost’s will consider this.
* Anthony Barbera reports that nonacademic assessment is due.  A system is in place as was developed by Kuldeep Puppala.  


V.        Provost’s Report


* The Provost reports on the task force for micro credentialing.  The actual resolution is passed out; this comes from the chancellor, goes to the board of trustees, and it sets out the rationale for micro credentialing.  Also handed out is more micro-cred info.  You can read about stacking credentials.  The full report is available from the Provost.  Every department received the full items.  We will handle them similar to minors.   Faculty comments that a minor is developed within an undergrad study from a program major, approved by that department.  A minor is structured and this is not necessarily true of micro credentials, which are not embedded in a program.    Anthony Barbera states that micro credentials would be approved by the same mechanism as minors, but that has not been approved yet.  On p. 6 in the report provided to departments you can see how Stony Brook does micro credentialing.  Andy Mattson comments that people are looking for skills without necessarily earning a BA.  Many people are looking for non-BA options and this may be an opportunity to bring people to campus.  This is our competition.  Many institutions provide micro credentialing online.


VI.        Old Business 


1. TLRC Update (Jill Crocker)


* There was a 2012 Resolution identifying space for teaching and learning excellence, and we are now piloting CETL (Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning).  CETL will pursue initiatives falling under the purview of TLRC but those that lie a bit beyond the scope of TLRC.  It is a pilot semester, so we will be seeking your feedback.  The center has also been referred to as TLC but this acronym is too close to the TLRC.  CETL is independent of TLRC, but TLRC is acting as a supporting advising structure.  The TLRC is overwhelmed with professional development demands for events, so CETL will be able to help take the load.  The librarians should be part of the conversation for where space is allocated for what in the library.  
* There is a spring conference Friday April 6.
* There is an OER workshop next Friday.
* You can earn a CETL certificate by attending 3 out of 4 of the CETL events listed on the handout, see meeting documents.
* See important dates on the handout; see meeting documents.
           
2. UUP update (Martha Livingston)


* The Janus Supreme Court case (was previously called Fredrich’s) may possibly do away with public union fees (agency fee payers).  This is impactful nationwide.  
* Sat the 24th at 11am at Foley Square in NYC there is a rally – see email sent out by UUP.  There is a bus, let us know if you want to ride the bus.
* Mon the 26th there is a protest rally in DC.  There are busses for this event.
* The AFT President will speak at Jericho High School on Tues the 27th, along with former head of NYSUT.
* SUNY has been dragging their heels about the contract.  Meetings have been delayed.  The main issue is money.  We want more money on-base in addition to the 2% that we presume we will get.  There is a general UUP meeting on the 28th in MPR at noon.  
* On Mar 1st every SUNY campus will have a fair contract rally.  Ours will be at noon, location TBD.
* There will be lots of signage available for faculty to display on their cars, offices, etc..
* Faculty Development Grants will not happen again until we have a contract.
* Let’s turn on the heat.
* We had a getting to tenure workshop.  There is an upcoming professionals workshop.
* Mar 8 or 9 (TBD) we want to get a meeting with our State Assembly member in order to put pressure on SUNY to keep funding raise funding for SUNY. 


VII.        New Business


1. Student Affairs (Omar Estrada Torres)


* Some offices were moved around in Student Affairs.  Usama Shaikh is now serving as the Acting Chief Diversity Officer.  There was an opening at the student division.  Jeff Bolding is the new Dean of Students.  Dr. Edwards sent out our annual report to department chairs.  There is a copy online – see it online.
* Omar has worked with Bill Kimmins to comply with sex discrimination and education.  There will be online education modules available to everyone.  You will see several emails from Bill.  Career planning is in H211.  We are looking for more faculty involvement -- email Omar or Usama if you are interested.  The office of Residential Life is moving from paper to online for signing up for housing.  There will be a campaign starting next week.  
* There will be media for student government elections.  Students will vote on whether the student activity fees will be mandatory or optional.
* The Residential Life office is currently interviewing RAs, and faculty may be asked to provide recommendation letters.
* The Faculty engagement in residential halls program is ongoing.  Faculty is encouraged to participate.
* Laurie Morris comments that at the plenary session there was discussion about changing the student fees.  We are one of the more active campuses.  Our activity fees is one of the lowest.
* Jennie D’Ambroise asks about the complaint process for the shuttle busses.  Omar reports that the Transportation Advisory Board (TAB) did not reconvene.  The maintenance operations website has a complaints procedure.  It is recommended for Tim McGarry and Bill Kimminns and Greg Riviero to report to the senate.  Faculty asks who is responsible for the busses and Omar replies the three names just mentioned.  Keep in mind that the traffic and the weather is prohibitive in terms of improving the bus shuttle schedule.  There are many different constraints, so changing the busses up or down by half hour will impact another group who will complain.  Faculty asks do we have resources to increase the number of busses?  Omar is not in a position to answer that.  Please note that there is an app to see where the bus is located.  Faculty comments the app is not fully working.
        
2. LEC update (Sarah Smith)


* Curriculum stipends of $1500 are available for dual designated liberal education courses, so they must meet 2 different liberal education domains in order to qualify.
Applicants need to discuss any new course with their chair first.  Applications are due April 1st.  Approvals will be notified by the end of the semester and courses would be developed over the summer.  Please reach out to the domain reps in order to offer a course in a particular area.  Please send questions to anyone on LEC including the Chair Llana Barbara. 


VIII.        Call to Faculty:  Other New Business


* Chair Andy Mattson encourages all to bring issues to the faculty senate.
* Ali Ebrahimi brings up the issue of outreach.  There are many things happening around us in the news.  We should focus on outreach.
* Steve Sienna provides cards about how to react to an active shooter.  Laurie Morris thanks Steve Sienna.  When will we have a drill?  There was a drill over the summer with staff, faculty, and students with the Department of Homeland Security.  Can we do a drill now while everyone is on campus?  We will look into it.  It may take some time to organize.  Faculty asks for a poster on every office and classroom door.  Faculty mentions that the faculty senate can do any policy, including statements about safety.  If a drill is performed there has to be proper codes and notifications.  The NAB classroom has windows to see in classrooms, and to lock the door from the inside you must open the door and swipe a card from the outside.  We made that decision so that you can see the classrooms, as being an open space.  Many spaces across campus are open spaces.  If we want to renovate then we should consider that.  We should do a live exercise.  An exercise may also show a person with ill intent to see what are the weak points of the response.  Keep in mind that a drill would not be manned in the same way that a true event would be manned – we could be criticizing the police department when it is not necessarily fully manned the same as a true event.  When you see a student acting erratically there is a very thoughtful process that is respective of the student in order to assess the situation (the behavioral assessment team BAT).  They will help you assess the level of reaction.  You can do this without chair/dean/etc..

IX.        Announcements


* Len Davis announces that we will hold on Apr 3rd a financial literacy fair.  Student debt is at an all time high.  Tax changes will be discussed.  It is open to the whole campus community.
