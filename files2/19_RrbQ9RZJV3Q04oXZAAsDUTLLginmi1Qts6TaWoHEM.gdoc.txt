At the 12/13 Cabinet meeting, the attached Policy Oversight Committee documents were presented by Chief of Staff Jo-Ann Robinson.  The charge of the committee and a proposed longer term membership list is not yet available and is being drafted, but they will be available and presented at the upcoming Feb 17 Full Faculty meeting.  In the meantime, review the attached documents for further discussion Feb 17.


The Provost has indicated that AA policies will need to go through the Policy Oversight Committee before becoming available, and the deadlines outlined in the recent Academic Policy Repository Resolution are not possible to meet.  The Provost can speak more to his collaboration with the policy committee in his report.
