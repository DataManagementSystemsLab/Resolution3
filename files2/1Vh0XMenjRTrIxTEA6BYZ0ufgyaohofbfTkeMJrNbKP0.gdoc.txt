Distance Learning Task Force from 2021
Last year in June of 2021 the Distance Learning Task Force (DLTF) provided recommendations to the Provost.  Ed Bever and I were co-chairs.  By the time Fall 2021 came around, I forgot to include it in a Senate agenda.  This is entirely my fault, and I apologize.


Since then, the Provost did not implement the revised Distance Learning policy, because of unclear language about modalities and course caps.  Faculty during the DLTF had also expressed similar concerns when they met in 2021.


Today Senate members are encouraged to review the DLTF recommendations, see attached.  During my report I will review the recommendations.
