MINUTES
* Approval of Minutes for April 9th, 2021                        
   * Provost requests amendment regarding DSI compensation which was not conveyed correctly.  The Provost said “Middle states institutional priorities and the strategic plan in appreciation of service, scholarship, and teaching.”  The Provost went on to say that “the DSI is not the appropriate mechanism, given the size of the pool, to deal with addressing the types of ongoing compensation concerns that have been expressed by faculty.”.
   * The minutes are approved by unanimous consent, pending edit above.
* Special Order of Business:                         
• Nominations & Election of Faculty Senate Chair (M. Dolan)
   * See meeting document information provided, regarding role and procedure for Senate Chair election.
   * Runi Mukherji nominates Jennie D’Ambroise, Mike Kavic seconds.  No other nominations.
   * Faculty asks for comments by the nominee, and expresses we need to debate things and not necessarily do everything by unanimous consent.  Nominee comments in agreement regarding robust debate, has been working in Senate since 2015, and interested in building institutional memory and transfer of knowledge from one generation to the next.
   * Elected by acclamation.
   * FJC Resolution                                                  
   * Change in name of the College-wide committee FJC to the new name Faculty Student Conduct Committee
   * See resolution in meeting documents.
   * We are not judge and jury, and the word “judicial” conveys a punitive tone.
   * Passed by unanimous consent.
   * OER Report & Motion For Renewal                        
   * OER saved students money on books
   * Please submit a syllabus for an OER course, any time, no time limit
   * State budget allocated new money for OER initiatives
   * See full OER report in meeting documents 
   * OER hosted events for students and faculty
   * Requesting extension for 3 years for the OER Committee to continue its work on an Ad Hoc basis.  
   * https://oer.suny.edu/ 
   * Questions arise about the status and why OER continues as an ad hoc committee. This will be revisited next academic year, at which time there will be a required 5-year bylaws review.  
   * Zero Textbook Cost (ZTC) designation in Banner is also part of some discussion.  This does not impact the current resolution, but this may be part of OER’s ongoing consideration next year.
   * Passed by unanimous consent
   * IT Governance Joint Task Force        
   * The task force was created in response to concerns that faculty voices are not being effective or heard in IT Governance.  
   * There is a need to develop better training resources so that new technology is fully utilized, including cost of training before purchasing new technology as well.
   * Resolution to create a college-wide committee ITGAC, see resolution in meeting documents.  ITGAC would have two faculty representatives (among other college-wide members including staff and student members, see charge in meeting documents).  Whether the two faculty are tenured would be the decision of the Faculty Senate but is not addressed here.  There is no faculty co-chair proposed here since staff members may also need faculty co-chair, so it was decided to not go this route.
   * The Resolveds also state that the senate will consider in the future whether a separate body of a standing committee of the senate (consisting of only faculty) can possibly be established in the future to provide more robust faculty input.  There is a separate initiative to create a Distance Learning committee, there may be overlap that we should consider.  This needs to be part of the larger 5-year bylaws revision next year.
   * The Provost expresses need for clarification regarding wording of IT resources and funding implications in the resolution.  Replies indicate that faculty need training to take advantage of new technologies, and that does indeed have funding implications.  Also consider the funding implications of new technologies that we have that are not being used effectively.
   * This vote will occur online.  Voting Senators watch out for the email.
   * CAP Resolutions, see meeting documents                        
   * CAP Res for Minor MC Revision Process Resolveds are read
   * Question arises about whether small changes to minors and micro-credentials may occur slowly over time, since the 50% criteria is non-cumulative.  Yes, that is correct, while it is a loophole, we must also consider that requiring a cumulative criteria may create unnecessary busywork for committee.
   * Passed by unanimous consent.
   * CAP Res PA BA in Media Production NFAV w PA Resolveds are read
   * Why not fiction?  Because of the expertise of the faculty in this program. 
   * Are there other programs that align with this for transfer students?  Some transfer students come with production classes fulfilled.  We will review more detail soon.  There are also micro-credentials that stack towards this degree, other departments are encouraged to do this.
   * Passed by unanimous consent.
   * CAP Res Certificate in 3D Digital Fab and Design w Proposal Resolved is read
   * For certificates the proposal goes to SUNY after the college approves it.
   * The certificates, and micro-credentials, are stackable with the major.
   * Non -matriculated students can show a form of credential to get credit, such as a portfolio, for admittance into the program (but not into the college).  Non-matriculated students have particular considerations such as financial and scheduling that should be considered and conveyed to students.
   * Passed by unanimous consent.
   * CAP Res BS in Physics w Proposal 
   * After SUNY approves this, SED also needs to approve it.
   * Career-oriented paths, with some courses pulled from other programs.
   * Passed by unanimous consent.
   * CAP Res AC in Accounting w Proposal resolved is read
   * Stackable credential, advanced courses without needing to pursue the master’s degree
   * Yes, these courses may be suitable for CPE credits, but that would need to be pursued.
   * Passed by unanimous consent.
   * CAP Res MC in Forensic Accounting w Proposal resolved is read
   * Stackable with the major
   * The name of a micro-credential cannot be named the same or similar to an existing degree name (anywhere, not just at Old Westbury).  There may be a name change in the future, but that would not be a substantive change.  Need to search on SED website for any degree at any school for similar names.  Frequently “foundations” or “foundations” is used.
   * Pending a future name change, passed by unanimous consent.


   * Flex Resolution Vote                                            
   * The resolution was read into the record at the previous meeting.
   * Flex teaching requires hardware and software that requires training.  Flex classes are conducted both online and in person together.  Contact Ed Bever if you are teaching Flex, previous training is considered for training requirements.  The classrooms are in the library, but in future they may be developed in NAB.  
   * Passed by unanimous consent
   * APPC Resolutions                                        
   * APPC Resolution to Adopt the SUNY FACT2 Recommendation for Requiring Cameras
   * Not require cameras unless there is a pedagogical need
   * Passed by unanimous consent
   * APPC Resolution on Establishing Limits to the Use of Credit-No Credit Toward Degree Completion
   * Number of Credit-No Credit courses would be limited college-wide, but departments have the flexibility to define departmental criteria
   * Questions from faculty and discussion
   * Is there any discussion about extending the CR/NC deadline?  It was recently extended to 7 weeks.  SGA President states students were not notified.
   * Faculty member’s department does not support the resolution.  We should be focused on supporting students.
   * This resolution would limit internships which are taken CR/NC.  Students may also want to take interesting courses CR/NC.  We must consider applied learning and internship.
   *  The criteria seems arbitrary.
   * The language says departments can add more restrictions, not that they can create exceptions.
   * If students took one course as CR/NC, out of typically enrolled in four courses, resolution authors thought that was reasonable.
   * SGA comments that even though the policy for the deadline was changed on CR/NC recently students were not informed, and so we should consider communication with students before passing such policy.
   * Tabled by unanimous consent.
   * Faculty requests we follow up on SGA President’s comment regarding not being informed about CR/NC deadline extension.  Provost responds that the calendars were updated immediately and the resolution was updated appropriately.  SGA President states that more could have been done for students, with email announcement as well as the calendar updates.  Provost agrees.
   * APPC Resolution on Changes to Language in College Policy Concerning the Consequences of Probation is read aloud
   * This policy would prevent, for example, a student from receiving C grade and not being allowed to participate in sports.
   * Question arises as to whether the policy verbiage should be included in the resolution.  The resolution only asks for changes to be made, but not what the changes are specifically.
   * Tabled for a moment, while the agenda moves on, we will return to this shortly.
   * Research Support Resolution         resolveds are read
   * Establish task force overseeing research enterprise needs including collaboration with various entities on campus, as well as future growth.
   * Resolution also says senate will consider creating a standing committee in the future
   * Faculty asks whether departments will be represented, and yes, this is reflected in the language.
   * Provost asks whether the word “oversight” implies that offices cannot perform their functions unless there is approval from the committee.  Is the resolution meant to address consultation, or what are the broader issues?  Faculty need a centralized place for purchase orders and other related matters.  This establishes only a task force to consider and standing committee.  
   * We may need to change the language from “commit” to a standing committee to rather “commit to explore” a standing committee.  This amendment is approved by unanimous consent.
   * Faculty asks whether departments will be represented.  This is what the proposed task force will consider.  The various constituencies are outlined in the resolution wording.  The meaning of the word “represent” implies normal governance processes.  Propose to change from “represent” to “representatives from”.  This amendment is approved by unanimous consent.
   * The vote is called. It will be conducted next week.
   * Back to APPC Resolutions
   * Back to APPC Resolution on Changes to Language in College Policy Concerning the Consequences of Probation
   * The language is read aloud, see meeting documents.
   * Groups, departments, and athletics will decide restraints, rather than restraints being prescribed.
   * The policy language is included as an amendment.  The amendment is passed with unanimous consent.
   * Resolution is passed by unanimous consent.
   * PRODiG Resolution preamble and resolved are read aloud                                
   * An intended amendment (not formally offered) regarding electing the members is presented.  This will be revisited in the fall semester.
   * Faculty asks what is the meaning of the word Asian?  We have many Indian, Pakistani, for example.  The PRODIG program has specific criteria that is not included here, this is just campus data.  Also, the terminology of the word Asian is an American terminology, but it is quite imperfect, and Asian can include so many.  The category of URM faculty needs to be revisited.
   * The DEI issue is intertwined, an element of the charge, but not the entire charge.  The PRODIG initiative is a SUNY-wide initiative. We are just getting PRODIG out of its beginning form on our campus, that is what the resolution is for.
   * Clarification that the lowercase “i” for PRODiG is to force the pronunciation to be like the word “prodigy”.
   * Passed by unanimous consent.
   * Bylaws working group                                                
   * Entered into record, will be dealt with at a future meeting.
