Dear colleagues,


As you know, Commencement is at Nassau Coliseum on Sunday, May 22 at 10am. Faculty are encouraged to attend and should be aware of the following details:
* Please arrive by or before 9 am.
* Masks are required to be worn by all students, faculty, staff, and guests.
* There is no fee for parking.
* After parking, go to the main entrance/Grant Thornton VIP Entrance (photo attached) and look for signs for the Candidate/Faculty entrance. Your academic regalia will allow entrance. 
* After passing through security, take the escalators or elevator to the Exhibition Hall. There will be light refreshments.
* Do not bring anything that you cannot carry with you as the Exhibition Hall will not be accessible after the processional.
* Faculty will participate in the processional and sit in the first several rows on the floor of the Coliseum.
* During your academic department's turn to have students cross the stage, if you'd like to stand to congratulate them as they return to their seats, please line up along the marked route below.
Faculty department marshals will receive a supplemental email from me with further information.


Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions.


Thank you,
